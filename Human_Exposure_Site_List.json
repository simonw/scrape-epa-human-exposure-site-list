For the upland portion of the Site, occupational workers have cumulative cancer risk above EPA’s acceptable cancer risk level. Construction/excavation workers have noncancer HI above 1. The primary risk driver is arsenic and PAHs. In the beach portion of the site, Tribal shellfish consumers had cumulative cancer risk above EPA’s acceptable cancer risk range and noncancer HI equal to 1. The primary risk drivers in sediment are arsenic and PAHs. The marine area adjacent to the former BGW property is designated as \"unclassified\" due to the proximity of CSOs, which precludes shellfish harvesting. A sign is also posted indicating the beach is closed and warning not to dig the sediment or harvest or consume shellfish. EPA is overseeing work on a feasibility study to develop cleanup options for the site, and will consider interim measures to reduce risk until a remedy is selected."

Also under current uses, construction and utility workers who work in trenches can be exposed to PCE via inhalation of PCE and TCE in groundwater vapors. Discussions regarding fencing and signage along the west side of Berwick Creek have been initiated (there is already a fence along the east side of Berwick Creek adjacent to Interstate 5), the signs will not be posted or a fence along the West side of Berwick creek will not be installed until the OU1 interim Remedial Action is initiated in 2020. The City of Chehalis does have a “call before you dig” ordnance which would be used to educate and limit exposures in trenches within OU1. In Operable Unit 2, the remedial investigation has yet to be completed. A number of properties within OU2 were connected to the Chehalis public-water supply system via an EPA removal action in the early 2000s, but many still obtain their drinking and shower water from private wells. To date, no site contamination has been found in these private wells; however, if PCE in groundwater continues to exist there is concern that the contaminated plume will reach these properties in the future. In response, EPA installed two groundwater monitoring wells upgradient of Rice Road properties that still use private drinking water wells. These two wells act as sentinels should the PCE plume change direction. To date, no PCE has been detected in these wells."

The Portland Harbor Potentially Responsible Parties, under EPA and DEQ oversight, have collected and analyzed sediment, surface water, groundwater, and fish tissue data at the site. Contaminants of concern include heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, PAHs, and dioxins/furans. The known exposure pathways for people are fish and shellfish consumption, ingestion of surface water, and direct contact with sediments. All of these pathways result in unacceptable exposures to humans. EPA has determined that the greatest health risk from exposure to contamination in Portland Harbor is from eating resident fish and to infants that are breast-fed by mothers who eat resident fish on a regular basis. The State Health Department has issued a health advisory and posted signs advising people to limit consumption of fish from the site. However, people are likely still eating the fish and fishing is observed daily at the site. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is working with upland facilities to investigate and control ongoing sources of contamination to the site. EPA issued a Record of Decision in 2017 and an Explanation of Significant Differences in 2019. The site is currently in Remedial Design. EPA posts major documents on its website and sends information regarding meetings and availability of major documents to a listserv (over 1,000 people) and has monthly meetings with the Citizen Advisory Group (which are open to the public). EPA has also reached out to neighborhood associations, non-profit environmental representatives and local organizations to provide training, small group discussions, presentations and multilingual materials regarding human health risks."

EPA selected a final cleanup plan in 2014 after consideration of public comments. The PRPs have initiated early cleanups at some particularly contaminated areas, mostly completed now, and these cleanups have reduced exposure to a degree. Remedial design and remedial action will take many years. Monitoring should demonstrate improvements as progress continues. Efforts to implement effective and appropriate ICs are in progress.

This site is within the Suquamish Tribes' Usual and Accustomed fishing area and is accessible by boat to the Tribe and the public. A Supplemental Mercury Investigation Report was completed by the Navy in 2017. The Navy is engaged with stakeholders to develop a focused feasibility study by 2020 and identify a remedy for OU B Marine by 2021 that addresses mercury source control and considers additional remedial actions for total mercury in sediment to reduce human health risks. The Washington Department of Health has a fish consumption advisory in place for Sinclair Inlet, and the Navy has an exclusion zone restricting access in the nearshore areas of their facility. A previous Record of Decision for OU B Marine addressed PCB contamination in fish tissue and sediments.  <br/><br/>The human health risk driver is currently mercury contaminated fish/shellfish consumption.  The Navy is working on a FFS for mercury in the Marine OU to address this risk.  The Navy has also completed a PFAS PA and will be scoping a SI in 2021 to determine PFAS risk to human health.<br/><br/>"

In the 2008, Sediment Tissue Long Term Monitoring report for OU2 Area 8, levels of cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury in littleneck clams harvested from seep areas exceeded levels deemed protective of human health. Currently, there are fish advisories in place to deter shellfish harvesting in this area.  The Navy controls access and the Suquamish Tribe has warned its members not to harvest or eat clams in this area. EPA has been told by Tribal representatives that tribal members generally adhere to the harvesting guidelines provided by the Tribe. Therefore, EPA and the state believe that there are adequate controls in place such that there is no likely exposure pathway for human health risk from consumption of littleneck clams near Area 8. However, the 2008 study identified potential sediment contamination from Area 8 seeps that may be a source of potential contamination in the deeper sub-tidal areas. This contamination may impact other fish in Liberty Bay that are not covered by the health department's fish advisories. The Navy’s most recent Five Year Review identifies this issue.  The Navy has collected additional data in accordance with a Sampling and Analysis Plan, and is performing both ecological and human health risk evaluations based on this data.  EPA estimates it will have sufficient information to determine the Human Exposure control status for this Site by 2021. "

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2021, the Commencement Bay, Near Shore/Tide Flats CERCLA site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control. Exposure to arsenic, lead, and benzene via soil, sediment and groundwater at concentrations greater than the cleanup goals established in the RODs are still occurring. Remediation of contaminated sediment in OU 01, which covers approximately 12 square miles, is not yet complete, and isolated areas of PCB contamination in the Hylebos Waterway sediments remain in the biologically active zone and surface water that bioaccumulate in fish tissue. Evaluation of PCBs will be conducted in 2022. Dioxins are also being evaluated in the Hylebos waterway - fish tissue samples were collected in 2019 and sediment samples were collected in 2021. Remediation of contaminated soil/slag in OU 02 (Former Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility) is occuring as areas of the site are redeveloped and is scheduled to be completed in June 2022. In the interim, human exposure to arsenic and lead in soil/slag is still possible. Institutional controls (temporary caps are in place at areas not yet remediated, fencing, air monitors) are in place to restrict access and reduce the potential for exposure by the community. Metro Parks Tacoma completed remediation of the Breakwater Peninsula in 2019 and redeveloped the area as a community park. During work being completed in 2017, it was determined that the shoreline cap installed by Asarco in 2001 has washed away and will need to be repaired. The shoreline cap repair will happen in 2022/2023. Institutional controls (signs) have been installed warning signs to prevent the public from entering this area until repairs are complete. In residential areas of Ruston and Tacoma (OU 04), exposure to lead and arsenic at concentrations posing unacceptable risk is still occuring via soil and household dust. EPA has remediated 1,990 properties and 452 rights-of-way, there are 4 properties undergoing active remediation, 3 properties needing RD/RA, 6 properties that refused remediation, and 23 properties that are located on steep slopes or in wetlands. Need institutional control (deed notices) to protect the remedy and limit future exposure to contaminated soil left in place. Other institutional controls (community protection measures) are being implemented by the State. Source control efforts have largely controlled contaminant migration from upland areas to Commencement Bay sediment (OU 05). However, localized areas of contaminated shoreline soil, groundwater, and uncontrolled sources continue to discharge to sediment and surface water. Groundwater is not a drinking water source and there is no human exposure route. Exposure to contaminated groundwater and sediment at the former Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility (OU 06) have not been fully controlled. While all historical infrastructure has been removed (OU 07), much of the site has been capped (see OU 02), and sources of contaminated soil have been removed and placed in an On-site Containment Facility (OCF). Groundwater monitoring wells are installed at the former Asarco Smelter site and GW monitoring will be conducted, and institutional controls prevent use of groundwater at the site. These wells will be installed later this year to commence monitoring the groundwater at the site. The sediments off-shore of the former Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility have been capped, but the sediments in the moderately impacted area and Yacht Basin have yet to be remediated. Contaminated sediments in the moderately impacted area and Yacht Basin pose little risk to humans as the potential for exposure is low."

Sediments and fish tissue in East Waterway are contaminated with PCBs, tributyl tin, TCDD, PAHs and metals. The most likely exposure pathway for people is fish and shellfish consumption. Dermal exposure is the next likely pathway. East Waterway is within the usual and accustomed fishing area of the Suquamish and Muckleshoot Tribes and there is anecdotal evidence that despite fish advisories people fish off the Spokane Street Bridge in East Waterway. All other operable units of this site have been cleaned up, have cleanups underway, or have been found not to need cleanup under Superfund. The results of the SRI/FS will enable EPA to make a cleanup decision for the EW OU of Harbor Island to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to control human exposures.  "

Mobile DNAPL has been transported by groundwater to off-shore sediments.  Dissolved constituents of DNAPL are still being transported by groundwater and upwelling through lake sediments.  The risk assessment indicates that use of groundwater for drinking water, dermal contact with surface and subsurface soils, vapor intrusion into occupied buildings, and consumption of even modest quantities of shellfish would all pose unreasonable risks to humans.  Benthic organisms, benthic macroinvertebrates, and terrestrial and aquatic-dependent wildlife are all subject to unacceptable ecological risks.  No one is currently using contaminated water as a drinking water supply, installation of wells is currently prohibited, and the site is vacant, fenced and posted, thus limiting human exposure to contaminated soils.  However, children may be exposed to contaminants when wading and, most importantly, EPA is concerned about shellfish consumption by the local community. Although there are no fishing advisories specific to the site, the state health department has issued one for Lake Washington to limit PCB consumption.   "

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of July 2021, the Wyckoff/Eagle Harbor Site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control. Ongoing creosote seeps on the beaches adjacent to a former wood treating facility provide a complete and direct exposure pathway to recreational and tribal beach users. Dermal contact and incidental ingestion of contaminated beach sediments results in a cancer risk above EPA’s risk range. Contaminant levels in shellfish tissue pose an unacceptable risk to both recreational and tribal shellfish harvesters. Signs are in place on the beach and in nearby parking lots and information kiosks to warn people of the risk. Information about the beach contamination is available on EPA’s web site. The beaches are closed to shellfish harvesting. The Washington Department of Health provides information about the closure on its web site. EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) amendment for the site in May 2018. EPA will use signage, fact sheets and social media to advise people of the contamination on the beaches until cleanup goals are achieved."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of July 2021, the Bunker Hill Superfund site’s measure of risks to people’s health is “Human Exposure Not Under Control.”  This is because some people living and working in and using the site for recreational purposes are exposed to elevated levels of lead and arsenic in soil, sediment, surface and drinking water.   Areas that could impact people’s health receive the highest priority for cleanup such as residential and commercial properties, school yards, parks, and mining sites that are close to homes or used for recreational purposes like riding All-Terrain-Vehicles (ATVs). <br/><br/>In the Bunker Hill “Box” communities (aka Operable Unit 1), about 3,200 properties have been cleaned up and 17 contaminated residential drinking water wells have been closed. Cleanup of the last eight Box residential properties will be completed when property owners grant access.  In the Bunker Hill “Coeur d’Alene Basin” communities (aka Operable Unit 3), about 3,900 properties have been cleaned up and seven homes provided under-sink water filtration systems.  Forty-eight additional properties have been sampled and require cleanup, but the owners have either refused or have not responded to multiple requests for access.  And approximately another 200 properties in the Basin remain to be sampled, but the owners of these properties have also refused access or are unresponsive.  A list of these types of properties is kept in case current owners change their minds or there is a change in ownership at which time requests for access begin again. <br/><br/>Reducing people’s exposure to elevated levels of lead and arsenic in soil, sediment, surface  and drinking water across the site is a multi-pronged approach.  In residential and commercial areas, it includes educational outreach, annual blood screening events, in-home assessments of sources of lead, and partial removal and replacement of contaminated soil.  Exposure to contaminated drinking water is reduced through public information efforts, supplying alternative sources of drinking water, installation of water filtration systems, and closing of drinking water wells.  Reducing exposure to contaminated soil at recreational areas and mine sites consists of a combination of access controls, signage, capping and removals.  <br/><br/>The site's vast size and high levels of contamination mean that cleanup will take several more decades, but many of the worse areas that affect people who live and work within the site have been addressed. Mine and mill site cleanups, as well as recreational sites, continue to be prioritized based on potential for lead exposure.  And overlaying these efforts is an Institutional Controls Program of locally developed and enforced rules and regulations to protect completed cleanups and limit exposures to contaminated soil currently left in place.<br/>"

EPA expects to submit the draft Human Health Risk Assessment to state and other stakeholders in January 2022. EPA expects to be able to make a final statement on HUEC around March 2022 after the HHRA has been reviewed by the State of California and finalized. The risk assessment evaluates the following major exposure pathways for people potentially exposed to site-related chemicals at and downstream of the mine: 1) fish consumption, and other recreational uses of Elliot Creek, Applegate River and Applegate Lake; 2) use of Elliot Creek water for drinking and irrigating vegetable gardens; and 3) direct contact with sediment and soil at the mine. Copper, cadmium, arsenic and zinc are the primary risk drivers. EPA installed two drinking water wells in April 2016 to replace seasonal use of Elliot Creek for drinking water and vegetable irrigation. Drinking water well sampling results from 2021 were below the MCL for all contaminants. CDPH also has a draft Public Health Assessment which was submitted for EPA review in March 2020 and should be available for public comment and finalized by spring 2022. This document will also help inform the HUEC performance indicator. Overall, it is expected that human exposure at the site is very limited given the site’s remote location and inaccessibility.<br/><br/>"

EPA has completed a remedial investigation and removal actions in 2006, 2011, and 2017 that have eliminated human exposures to contaminated residential soils. However, actions to address the mine tailings in tailings piles, drainages, flood plains, behind the dam, and on the former smelter property, are ongoing, pending completion of the feasibility study. These are not areas of usual human contact. However, while certain institutional controls are in place and human exposure is not certain, there could be casual/short-term human contact with these tailings and occasional inhalation hazards in the immediate tailings areas during high winds.  There are tailings areas that cannot be effectively sealed off from all human access in all situations.  Such conditions will likely persist until such time as mine tailings and wastes are removed and capped in the remedial action to be selected by the ROD.  The primary chemicals of concern at the site are arsenic and lead. Sampling results indicate the presence of elevated levels of arsenic and lead that could present health risks if a person is exposed to these metals over an extended period of time.  In the last year EPA has posted numerous danger signs near contaminated areas.  EPA has conducted a removal action to place an effective seal on waste dross material at the smelter to prevent aerial entrainment of dust, and to install a fence with warning signs, cutting off an access path children may have used to access the smelter plateau and dross.  We have also  reinforced gates to prevent casual access.  At the separate massive mine tailings pile at the former mine, thousands of feet of new fencing has been installed in an attempt to limit or eliminate human access to the pile.  EPA communicates to Dewey-Humboldt residents on a regular basis via the Town Newsletter and meetings with the Town Council."

The current complete human exposure pathway is ingestion of methyl mercury contaminated fish tissue.   <br/><br/>The site consists of three OUs; OU 1) the 320 acre mercury mine site property; OU 2) seven miles of Las Tablas Creek downstream from the mine, which includes a man-made reservoir of 7 acres with a 15 foot depth; and OU 3) which is Lake Nacimiento reservoir at the end of Las Tablas Creek, which covers 1,800 acres, is 14 miles long and up to 180 feet deep, and is used for irrigation and drinking water.<br/><br/>The State of California has issued fish consumption advisories for methyl mercury in fish tissue in Lake Nacimiento in 1994 and 2007. This advisory remains in place, however Lake Nacimiento is a popular location for recreational fishing. Signage regarding the fish consumption advisory has been posted around Lake Nacimiento, as well as around all the smaller water bodies impacted by site-contamination between the mine site and Lake Nacimiento. A Human Health Risk Assessment was completed for OU 3 - Lake Nacimiento in 2018. Targeted outreach to Environmental Justice communities was implemented in 2014 and in 2018 additional resources were committed to renew community involvement work to target this exposure pathway.  <br/><br/>Human exposure to contaminants at OU 1 is limited by fencing and controlled access. Access to OU 2 is similarly limited because these lands are privately owned.  <br/>"

First, individuals are known to catch, consume, and sell (for consumption) fish from the area. Second, individuals may be exposed to mercury-contaminated surface or subsurface soil. <br/><br/>The Site, which includes the Lahontan Reservoir, Washoe Lakes, Carson Lake and Indian Lakes, is a recreational (fishing and hunting) destination in Nevada. In general, people should not consume fish, waterfowl or wild plants collected in the area. The Nevada Department of Health and Human Services has issued health advisories for fish consumption from Big and Little Washoe Lakes, Lahontan Reservoir, and the Carson River downstream from Dayton. The Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) recommends not eating fish downstream of the Mexican Dam (other than trout), upstream from Dayton. Fish with very high levels of mercury have been found in these areas. At heavily used access locations to these water bodies, EPA, NDEP and NV Parks have posted health advisory signs to warn the public that fish should not be consumed. EPA released a fish advisory risk communication strategy with TASC assistance, including close coordination with the State. <br/><br/>EPA is also concerned children may be exposed to mercury-contaminated soil located subsurface or on the surface around source areas (former mills or tailings piles) subsequently developed as residences around Virginia City, Silver City, Dayton, Gold Creek Canyon, Six and Seven Mile Canyons, and within the Carson River 100-year flood plain. EPA and private parties have conducted multiple cleanup actions to excavate or cap mercury-contaminated surface soil in the surrounding area. However, many areas still have mercury-contaminated soils (as well as arsenic and lead associated with the ore milling process) under the surface or on the surface. These areas must be managed appropriately. The EPA and NDEP work with local jurisdictions, residents, and commercial parties to implement the Long-Term Sampling and Response Plan to address these concerns (Operable Unit 1). In 2018, EPA completed a Five-Year Review of the mercury-contaminated areas near the source areas (OU1) to document how effectively cleanup actions are working to protect human health and the environment. In March 2017, EPA released a Remedial Investigation (RI) report (including the Human Health Risk Assessment), followed by the Feasibility Study (December 2018) for Operable Unit 2 of the Carson River and associated impacted waterways and wetlands. EPA issued the Proposed Plan late September 2021, extended the public comment period through February 14, 2022 and expects the Record of Decision in late 2022.<br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of October 2021, the Fort Ord Superfund site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control because trespassers can come into contact with munitions and explosives of concern (MEC), specifically in the 8000 acre impact range with an 11 mile perimeter. Since 2009 the U.S. Army has maintained fences throughout impacted areas, posted warning signs, sent fact sheets about the site, increased trespassing penalties, and conducted briefings in local schools and at community events encouraging people not to enter the site.  However, trespassing incidents continue to occur. In 2008, the Army and EPA selected a final remedy to, among other things, remove MEC from the surface. Significant progress in implementing the remedy has been made but as of 2021, the Army estimates that it will take at least another 8-10 years at the current pace, due to California’s wildfire danger and endangered species challenges associated with conducting vegetation clearance activities (in support of MEC removal)."

The area is restricted by fencing and multilingual warning signs are posted on the upland fence and along the marine channel, visible to individuals fishing in boats; however, there have been reports of individuals fishing in the area. These measures do not prevent contaminated fish from migrating outside of the site where they might be harvested and consumed by individuals. EPA is continuing preparation of a focused feasibility study to evaluate alternatives for addressing the remaining contamination. EPA presented to the National Remedy Review Board and is currently working on revising the focused feasibility study. In addition, EPA sends fact sheets to the site's mailing list, updates the site's Web page, and makes presentations to the City as needed. The upland (soil) portion of the site is considered under control. The five-acre site has been capped and in reuse for industrial purpose since October 1999."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of October 2021, the Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control. Consumption of mercury-contaminated fish from the adjacent Clear Lake is a complete pathway that poses health risks. <br/><br/>Site-related mercury has contaminated lake sediments in Clear Lake. Bioaccumulation of this mercury has resulted in elevated fish tissue methylmercury levels. For this reason, in 1987, 2009, 2014 and 2019, the State of California has issued and reissued a fish consumption advisory at Clear Lake. This information is distributed online and in the fishery regulations booklet provided to fishing license holders. EPA is currently pursuing increased community involvement efforts around this issue, following reports that the community is not being provided clear and consistent information around this issue.  <br/><br/>Potential trespassers onto the mine property itself may come into contact with mine wastes and soils contaminated with mercury, arsenic, and antimony. This exposure has been limited by site controls including fencing and signage. EPA's human health risk assessment shows that a recreational/trespass scenario is an unacceptable risk due to the high levels of mercury and arsenic present in the mine waste.  The risk assessment is based on exposures to youth, ages 6-17, that are most likely to recreate at the mine property.  <br/><br/>Mine waste present in the residential areas south of the site and on the Elem Indian Colony adjacent to the site also pose a risk to human health. In 1997, 2007 and 2010 EPA completed the removal actions to excavate and cap areas of contaminated mine wastes and soils in these residential areas. <br/><br/>EPA is performing a feasibility study to select a cleanup plan to prevent the continued discharge of mercury and other contaminants to Clear Lake and to clean up the contaminated mine wastes at the mine property.  EPA is continuing its remedial investigation to characterize the nature and extent of contamination in Clear Lake sediments and the North Wetland. EPA is also conducting a site-wide human health risk assessment to quantify risks from the site. EPA ensures community members know about and participate in site issues by holding community meetings, distributing outreach materials, and coordinating with the Elem Pomo Tribe."

EPA is overseeing early response actions that address releases of mining-influenced water to a mountain stream system, but has not completed a risk assessment for the entire site to quantify any remaining exposure to humans. The Risk Assessment involves over nine miles of potentially contaminated riparian area downstream of the mine. The surface water is not used as drinking water. Quantification of human risk is also complicated by consideration of exposure patterns unique to the Washoe Tribe whose members use this watershed. The site's location at 7,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada allows only limited seasonal access. The data gathering for the formal risk assessment is underway with an Administrative Order issued on June 23, 2008. The Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) is expected to be completed over the next several years."

This adit mine drainage is located along a highway with intermittent foot traffic. Until this flow is controlled or treated, the human exposure potential will continue to exist for those individuals hiking in this area. Exposure through fish consumption is not expected to be significant because none of the metals (copper cadmium and zinc) found in the discharge bio-accumulate in fish at the concentrations and area of the River that is impacted by mine drainage. This site has recently been listed on the NPL and contracting and studies are under way to understand steps to control or treat the mine drainage."

EPA's main concern is whether TCE from Site measured in indoor air pose an unacceptable risk of short-term and chronic health effects due to TCE inhalation exposure. EPA has been implementing the 2010 vapor intrusion remedy to address buildings where elevated TCE and PCE concentrations have been found in indoor air. All nonresidential buildings overlying the shallow TCE groundwater contamination have been sampled to determine the appropriate response action and  vapor intrusion control systems have been installed in all new buildings in the vapor intrusion study area. A Site-wide Shallow Zone Feasibility Study is currently underway to establish a framework and evaluate alternative groundwater cleanup technologies to address the source of vapor intrusion. The activities planned to make the Human Exposure Control determination include completion of the sewer pathway and building specific evaluations, where necessary, and implementing any necessary response actions."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2021, the Montrose superfund site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control because the Palos Verdes Operable Unit has ocean sediment contaminated with significant levels of DDT and PCBs. These contaminants impact fish that reside in the area, especially the white croaker. Human exposure occurs through consumption of contaminated fish caught within the Palos Verdes Shelf area. The fish advisory from the State of California added barred sand bass and topsmelt to the \"do not consume\" list for PV Shelf. There are institutional controls (ICs) in place, which include white croaker bag limits, advisories and warnings for the area, educational outreach programs, and a commercial fishing ban on catching white croaker from the PV Shelf. However, periodic monitoring of the local fishing piers show that white croakers are being caught by independent fishermen for consumption. The selected remedy includes continuation of the Institutional Controls (ICs) program along with monitored natural recovery (MNR) and capping the most contaminated sediments. The comprehensive ICs program has been effective in reducing -- but not completely eliminating -- the consumption of white croaker and fishing of white croaker in the contaminated area.  In light of new MNR data which appears to indicate that the hotspot capping component of the interim remedy is no longer necessary and in consultation with the Palos Verdes Shelf Technical Exchange Group, EPA is currently working on the consulting contract for the Feasibility Study with Updated Conceptual Site Model And Risk Assessment.  The new Feasibility Study will select the final remedy for Palos Verdes Shelf.  EPA will continue the current ICs program (education, outreach, monitoring, and enforcement) until a final remedy is selected for the site. <br/> "

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of October 2021, there is insufficient data to determine the site-wide Human Exposure Control status at Motorola 52nd Street Superfund Site in OU2. Prior to this, EPA was concerned that contaminated groundwater may be causing vapor intrusion (VI) into residential and/or commercial buildings in OU2. The contaminants are VOCs including TCE and PCE. There are 3 Operable Units (OUs) at the site. ADEQ has the lead for OU1 and OU2 groundwater, and EPA has the lead for vapor intrusion. EPA is the lead for both groundwater and vapor intrusion for OU3. The ongoing RIs will include remedial actions to address the vapor intrusion pathway, as warranted. Operable Unit 1: In April 2009, EPA informed ADEQ that EPA would take the lead for investigating the vapor intrusion pathway. The off-site/residential area VI investigation began in 2010 and was completed in 2018. It included several rounds of soil vapor sampling, followed by indoor air monitoring, and frequent community meetings/presentations/fact sheets. Sixteen sub-slab mitigation systems (mitigating 18 homes – one is a multi-unit dwelling) have been installed at residences throughout the area and are regularly monitored. A sub-slab mitigation system was installed at a commercial building owned by the Arizona Department of Transportation in Fall of 2017. An in-situ pilot study began in January 2018 to evaluate whether injection of liquid-granulated-activated-carbon will reduce vapor intrusion in neighborhoods where mitigation systems are installed. This project is completed in 2021. It is an effective short-term solution, but not viable as a long-term remedy. The Former Motorola Plant Campus (on-site) investigation began in 2015 and was completed in 2017. Again, multiple rounds of soil gas and indoor air sampling and were conducted at the buildings throughout the complex. EPA also provided community presentations, fact sheets and handouts. Vapor intrusion was not found to be occurring throughout the complex. Operable Unit 2: The VI investigation began in 2017 and is ongoing. Where soil gas data indicated a potential for V, indoor air sampling conducted to-date indicates vapor intrusion is not occurring in the buildings sampled. Multiple indoor air and twelve soil gas sampling events have been completed, including additional step-out sample areas that were needed to bound the soil vapor concentrations to concentrations lower than the SGHHSLs. Additional indoor air sampling is needed where access has been difficult to obtain because residents are reluctant during  of covid-19. Operable Unit 3: EPA conducted limited VI sampling at locations in OU3 during the TAGA (mobile lab) sampling event in 2014. A small TCE soil gas plume exists in OU3. Confirmation soil gas sampling was conducted in 2020 to determine if potential vapor intrusion exists for nearby commercial buildings. The results indicated indoor air sampling is needed in two buildings, including a residential hotel, when access can be obtained. The results will enable EPA to make a Human Exposure determination for the site and to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to control exposures, if necessary - particularly in OU2. Covid-19 shelter-in-place has halted plans for indoor air sampling from 2019 to date.  <br/><br/>"

Prior to the strike, a human health risk assessment was being conducted as part of the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS). One potential pathway for human exposure is inhalation of airborne contaminants and fugitive emissions when the smelter is operating. An air monitoring network is in place at the site and air monitoring data continues to be collected while the strike is occurring. The Chemicals of potential Concern (COPCs) for the inhalation pathway include arsenic, lead, copper and sulfur dioxide. Recent air monitoring results show an improvement in air quality as the smelter facility is not operating. Asarco completed many of the major facility upgrades in December 2018 and EPA continues to review the air monitoring data. The most recent air monitoring data while the smelter was operating continued to show that levels of arsenic and lead contamination exceeded the trigger levels established in the Air CD. EPA, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) and the University of Arizona are working together to conduct community outreach including public meetings in Hayden and Winkelman. In light of mandatory travel and gathering restrictions due to COVID-19, the next public meeting will very likely be virtual."

Site investigations are underway addressing chemicals of concern (principally organochlorine compounds as TEQ toxicity, with contributing arsenic) in soils, sediments, slurry-sludges, waters and air. Because of the nature of the industrial operations and site-management activities, human exposure to the contaminated surface-media is presently controlled in a manner that limits the exposure-frequency. If changed-conditions were to increase the exposure frequency and/or duration, cancer-risk thresholds could reasonably result in unacceptable human-health risk at several locations across the Site. This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because cancer-risk thresholds often exceed the de minimus regulatory level of 1x10-6 based on preliminary risk-assessment calculation.<br/><br/>Evaluating the source, releases, and exposure scenarios at this Site involving releases of gaseous chlorine (and hydrochloric acid) to the ambient air surrounding the Site presented unprecedented challenges for risk assessment. Releases to the atmosphere associated with typical operating conditions have been evaluated for short-term episodic exposure and risk. However, longer term (days to weeks) exposure and risk-evaluation associated with the period when NO chlorine control by the CRB (chlorine reduction burner) is operating have not been evaluated. Problematic exposure-effects have occurred within the 5-mile remedial investigation study area. Until such time as that exposure-scenario is evaluated, unacceptable human exposure effects could occur. Risk-response options under both the Clean Air Act and/or CERCLA are under consideration. <br/><br/>To date, the planned activities to address Site conditions are beginning under a RCRA-CERCLA Enforcement Settlement Consent Decree with US Magnesium entered in Federal District Court in June 2021. Site management activities between EPA programs and the State of Utah are being arranged. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, please contact EPA’s Community Involvement Coordinator with your questions. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by December 31, 2030 because of response plans under development. <br/><br/>With entry of the Settlement Consent Decree, the portions of the Site that will be under CERCLA management, will now be able to proceed with the more traditional implementation of the Superfund process outlined in the National Contingency Plan, including more robust engagement with the community (TAG) interest group.<br/>"

Separate Remedial Investigations/Feasibility Studies (RI/FS) for both Operable Unit 1 (Community Properties) and Operable Unit 2 (Former Smelter Area) began in 2014. A plan proposing an early interim action was issued for the residential properties' indoor dust and soil cleanups in Operable Unit 1 (OU1 - Community Properties) in July 2017 due to exposures to lead- and arsenic- contaminated soil and indoor dust. EPA signed the Interim Record of Decision (i-ROD) in September 2017 and residential soil and indoor dust sampling and cleanups are ongoing. To date, 248 indoor dust cleanups and 657 soil cleanups have been completed; resident relocation is not required during the cleanups. The soil exposure and indoor dust-inhalation/exposure pathways are considered unacceptable based on EPA’s Site-specific i-ROD cleanup criteria not having been met for all the OU1 properties. Site-specific i-ROD cleanup criteria are Lead: 350 ppm soil, 275 ppm indoor dust; Arsenic: 61 ppm soil and indoor dust. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by 2032 for this OU because we anticipate having our cleanup complete and Institutional Controls in place.<br/><br/>The Operable Unit 2 (OU2 - Former Smelter Area) RI/FS is ongoing. Caution and No Trespassing signs were placed around the former smelter area in 2015. Despite the signage, there are several unhoused people continually living on OU2 and an active railroad prohibits fully limiting access to OU2 slag areas. One year of quarterly air monitoring (March 2018 to March 2019) showed that smelter area contaminants are not being entrained into adjacent neighborhoods. Quarterly surface water sampling with collocated sediment and pore water samples were collected in 2019 and depending on available funding, OU2 RI Work Plan updates and RI/FS tasks, including GW investigation, are estimated to continue in late 2023 (2024/Q1). The delayed OU2 schedule means that all media, pathways, and contaminants of concern have not been fully characterized. <br/><br/>EPA RPMs and Community Involvement Coordinators (CICs) conduct extensive and ongoing community outreach to inform residents and property owners of the Site contaminants, potential exposure risks and best management practices for reducing exposure to lead contaminated soils and indoor dust. Outreach includes participation by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (support agency) and the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment. EPA also provides a cooperative agreement to, and works closely with, the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment who conducts blood-lead screening, home lead risk assessments, consumer product screening, and an extensive outreach and education program in the Site study area and to medical professionals. <br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2021, the Upper Tenmile Creek Mining Area Superfund site is considered “Current Human Exposure Not Under Control” (HENC). Concerns for the human exposure pathways include one partial residential soil remedial action yet to be taken, potential community access to nearby waste piles from former mining operations (approximately 35 of the original 70 piles have not yet been addressed), and the stockpile of contaminated residential soils that were relocated to the RV Ranch property as funding was not available to transport the material to the Luttrell Regional Repository. The soils in this stockpile contain up to 10,000 ppm lead. The remedial action levels defined in the 2002 Record of Decision are 100 parts per million for arsenic and 400 parts per million for lead. The 2008 Record of Decision Amendment indicates drinking water for the Rimini community will be sourced from Tenmile Creek to address the human ingestion pathway concerns. However, there are eight major contributing adit discharges and associated outfall sediment loads that require remediation before the creek may be used as a drinking water source. Currently, most residences in Rimini, and those nearest the Tenmile Creek in the Landmark Subdivision, are provided drinking water via the EPA Bottled Water Program administered through a cooperative agreement with Lewis & Clark County. Use of private drinking water wells is considered unacceptable because levels of arsenic and other mining-associated metals levels exceed the drinking water standards (MCLs) by orders of magnitude<br/><br/>To date, the planned activities to address these pathways are waiting for design and remedial action funding. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, please contact the Lewis & Clark County Health Department at (406) 457-8900 or (406) 447-8351 for information and assistance related to the EPA Bottled Water Program. EPA and MDEQ currently anticipate that human exposure will be under control by September 30, 2028, pending receiving funding to conduct the work.<br/>"

If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, please avoid areas that have been identified as having soil concentrations that are unsafe consistent with Agency outreach. In addition, please ensure that you obey informational signs and do not recreate in the Waterman smelter area. UDEQ and EPA currently anticipate that human exposure will be under control by December 30, 2023, however, that date is dependent on receipt of Federal funding. <br/><br/>The Jacobs Smelter site is a state-lead NPL site. Cleanups in Operable Unit (OU) 1 (Former Jacobs Smelter area) and OU3 (Stockton Rail Yard) have been completed and those OUs have been deleted from the NPL. Cleanup has also been completed at OU4 (Kennecott Parcel) and the region will be working with headquarters to delete this OU in the future. At OU2, the Rawhide Ranchettes, which is a residential area within the OU, have been remediated. At OU5 (BLM Parcel), some work has been completed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) under a removal action, however, additional work is needed on a second parcel in OU5 to determine whether it should be included in the NPL site and whether additional cleanup actions may be necessary. A Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) is planned for OU6 (Former Chicago and Carson Buzzo Smelters area) following completion of the Remedial Action at OU2. EPA plans to conduct this additional investigative work at OU6 to assess the potential ecological and human health exposures. <br/>"

The remedial investigations at OU2 (the former Omaha & Grant Smelter) and OU3 (the former Argo Smelter) are ongoing, but there are known elevated levels of contaminants in groundwater and sub-surface soils in these areas. The main contaminants of concern at OU2 and OU3 are heavy metals including lead and arsenic. In OU2, land use determinations, and therefore potential human health exposures, are in flux due to development activities in the area. In OU3, the exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because the groundwater concentrations of arsenic, lead and cadmium are above the drinking water standards (MCLs). The groundwater in this area, however, is not used for drinking.<br/><br/>To date, the planned activities to address these pathways are to collect samples in OU2 to complete the remedial investigation. At OU3, the next step is to complete the feasibility study. This study will evaluate possible alternatives to clean up OU3. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, you can contact the Community Involvement Coordinator for details.

The cleanup standards in the ROD are 400 mg/kg for lead and 100 mg/kg for arsenic. The cleanup is in the queue of sites to be funded. <br/><br/>EPA has also completed site-wide remedial investigations and is working on a solid source media feasibility study that addresses solid source mine waste and fluvial deposits in the Carpenter and Snow Creek watersheds. EPA will follow this with an interim Record of Decision to address the solid source media in Operable Unit 3 (Carpenter Creek), which is planned for December 2023. Another interim ROD addressing the solid source media in Snow Creek Operable Unit 2 is planned for December 2024. In addition, EPA and the US Forest Service have conducted multiple removal actions to reduce human exposure and address multiple safety hazards. These include on site demolition of degraded chemicals and dynamite, removal of electrical transformers containing PCB fluids, surface water diversions, and excavation and on-site placement of over 50,000 cubic yards of mine waste. EPA will continue to use removal authority to address the mine waste piles that have the greatest potential to erode in nearby surface water bodies until a final ROD can be issued in 2031. <br/><br/>EPA is also working with two Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) to pilot test source control measures to address mine-influenced waters coming from two discharging mine adits in the Carpenter Creek (OU3) drainage. EPA continues to provide residents and recreationalists with information to reduce exposures to potentially contaminated sources such as soils, sediments, surface water and groundwater. Remedial action completion of a final aqueous (water) source remedy media is anticipated to be completed December 2040. This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because on site workers, residents and recreationalists can be exposed through direct contact to mine waste and sediment containing thallium, manganese, lead and arsenic in contaminated source materials, fluvial deposits and residential soils as well as mine influenced water discharging from multiple adits containing concentrations of lead, iron, zinc, cadmium, copper and thallium above federal maximum contaminant levels.<br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2021, the Hill Air Force Base Superfund site is considered “Current Human Exposure Not Under Control” (HENC). This is due to Vapor Intrusion (VI) both on and off Base which is being addressed under OU 15. The Remedial Action Objective of OU 15 is to prevent human exposure by inhalation to indoor air concentrations that are present due to VI above the contaminant’s respective risk-based action levels. Action levels are based on a cancer risk of 1 in 100,000 or a Hazard Quotient of 1. The VI exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria. Some of the major contaminants of concern are TCE, PCE, VCL, and 1,2-DCA. OU 15 is unique in that there is only one contaminated medium (indoor air) and one exposure pathway (inhalation). The vapor sources are being remediated as part of the other OUs for soil and/or groundwater contamination. Therefore, the remedy for OU 15 focuses on preventing exposure and not treating the vapor sources. The OUs at Hill AFB which have vapor intrusion issues are OU1, OU2, OU4, OU5, OU6, OU8, OU10, and OU 12. Groundwater contaminated by solvents beneath buildings and homes is the main source of the vapors. OU 1 and OU 2 however are a bit unique in that the VI is due to sewer gas. The vapors intrude into the basement through cracks and joints. The Air Force has developed an ongoing yearly program to investigate as many as 2,400 buildings (residents and businesses) and install vapor intrusion mitigation systems (VIMS) as needed to protect human health. To date, 129 VIMS have been installed. <br/><br/>To date, the most significant activity planned to address this pathway is the finalization of the OU 15 Record of Decision (ROD). This ROD is very similar to the current Time-Critical Removal Action (TCRA) which has been in place since 2003. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, under the current TCRA and the forthcoming ROD, residents and business owners may contact the Base to have their properties sampled and a VIMS installed at no cost, if warranted. Hill AFB and EPA currently anticipate that human exposure will be under control by 12/31/2025 because new expanded outreach efforts have been developed over the past two years to contact more residents face-to-face to obtain approval to sample their homes and businesses. The 2025 date may need to be reevaluated given the current COVID-19 home access challenges.<br/><br/>"

The identified source of contamination is the historic dry-cleaning operation at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. The 700 South 1600 East PCE Site was finalized on the National Priorities List on May 24, 2013. <br/><br/>As the lead agency, the VA completed a Remedial Investigation including Human Health Risk Assessment for Accelerated Operable Unit 1 (AOU1). This investigation focused on the vapor intrusion pathway for contaminants, which can occur in shallow groundwater and enter buildings through small cracks in the foundation. Of the residences tested, only one home required installation of a vapor mitigation system. Three additional residences were provided temporary controls. Subsequently, AOU1 was merged with groundwater OU2 to form a new site-wide “OU1”. <br/><br/>To date, the planned activities to address this pathway include a comprehensive Remedial Investigation (RI) and Human Health Risk Assessment for OU1, which will continue to evaluate the vapor intrusion pathway on a larger scale, as well as any potentially complete exposure pathways from groundwater and/or surface water. This RI will determine the site-wide nature and extent of contamination and provide a more thorough assessment of human health exposure potential. EPA anticipates that human exposure will be under control by 2026 (or sooner) when a final remedy is implemented. <br/><br/>If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this Site, the VA is currently providing free indoor air quality testing for homeowners. If warranted, the VA will provide a vapor extraction system at no cost. EPA will continue to ensure that any unacceptable exposures are addressed. Ongoing community outreach activities are being conducted at this Site.<br/>"

The Utah Power and Light/American Barrel Superfund site was recently evaluated for its fifth Five-Year Review (FYR), and recommendations from that review indicate that there is insufficient data to make a Human Exposure determination.<br/><br/>EPA uses this Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occuring, and that those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. As of September 2021, the planned activities to collect sufficient information to make a human exposure evaluation are to conduct a vapor intrusion study at the North Sixth Apartments. A vapor intrusion investigation was recommended during the 2016 fourth FYR, based on information identified during the 2011 vapor intrusion. In August 2018, PacifiCorp submitted a Response to Recommendation/Follow-up Action for Indoor Air Sampling and a Vapor Intrusion Investigation from the Fourth Five-Year Review, American Barrel Superfund Site. The Johnson and Ettinger model was used in this evaluation to determine if the soil vapor posed a potential risk to persons inside the North Sixth Apartments. Although residential units are not located on the first floor, to be conservative the Johnson and Ettinger model was run for a potential residential exposure. The model indicated that the concentrations detected in the soil-gas would not translate into a residential exposure above target levels. The report also identified difficulties in conducting vapor intrusion sampling due to elevated background benzene concentrations that would be present given the building’s urban location and the thickness of the building foundation (3 feet thick) that would prohibit sub-slab sampling.  <br/><br/>After reviewing the document and conclusions of PacifiCorp’s August 2018 response, the EPA and UDEQ determined that the Johnson and Ettinger modeling conducted would not be sufficient to determine risk posed by the vapor intrusion pathway.  The EPA and UDEQ will require a comprehensive VI investigation, including indoor air sampling, to evaluate the vapor intrusion pathway for the North Sixth Apartments. EPA and UDEQ currently anticipate that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure determination by December 1, 2022. This date is anticipated because it will provide the time to plan and implement a comprehensive vapor intrusion investigation and provide enough time to analyze the results.<br/><br/>Note that this does not necessarily mean that unacceptable exposures are occurring. If you live near this site and have questions, please contact EPA or UDEQ at one of the contacts on the site web page."

The ongoing Remedial Investigation and well survey data for off-site domestic water indicate PFAS migration in ground water and surface water extends at least 30 miles off-base to the south and east. <br/><br/>Beginning in October 2018, the Air Force started supplying alternative water where drinking water concentrations are above the EPA health advisory of 70 parts per trillion (ppt). Concentrations up to 13,870 ppt PFOA⁄PFOS were found in drinking water and 17,370 ppt in irrigation wells. Several Removal Actions have been taken to provide alternative water supplies, including bottled water, water filtration systems, larger treatment systems, or connecting to existing water lines. However, the Air Force ended restrictions on the use of drinking water wells in an area known to have high levels of PFOA/PFOS. Human exposure could come under control as soon as the extent of the plume is identified, alternate sources of drinking water are supplied, and ICs are implemented now tentatively estimated by 9/30/2027.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2021, the Anaconda Aluminum Co Columbia Falls Reduction Plant Superfund site is considered “Current Human Exposure Not Under Control” (HENC). A byproduct of the aluminum reduction process is spent potliner (SPL), which is known to contain cyanide and fluoride. SPL was disposed of onsite in several landfills between 1955 – 1990. An Administrative Order on Consent for the Remedial Investigation (RI) and Feasibility Study (FS) was signed in late 2015. The RI Report was finalized on February 21, 2020 and the FS Report was finalized on June 16, 2021. The findings from the RI indicate that PAHs (soil and sediment), cyanide (groundwater), and fluoride (groundwater) are the Contaminants of Concern (COCs) that are the primary risk drivers at the Site. The results of the RI indicate that groundwater is the primary migration pathway for the potential transport of COCs from the various source areas. In addition, results indicate that cyanide and fluoride are the primary COCs from a contaminant migration/fate and transport perspective. The exposure pathways are considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because they contribute to risk estimates that exceed acceptable levels for potential human health risk (i.e., excess lifetime cancer risk of 1E-06 for carcinogens; or hazard index of 1 for non-carcinogens) or pose moderate or higher risk from the ecological perspective (i.e., lowest observed adverse effect level Hazard Quotient values greater than 1 for at least one receptor).<br/><br/>To date, the planned activities to address this pathway will be identified and detailed in EPA’s proposed plan and Record of Decision. The proposed plan and Record of Decision will be finalized in 2022. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by December 31, 2028.<br/><br/>In addition, the PRP implemented a time critical removal action in Fall 2020/Spring 2021 at the South Percolation Ponds. The South Percolation Ponds were the only feature within the River Area Decision Unit (DU) that contained sediments with COCs at concentrations exceeding preliminary remediation goals. This work was implemented in advance of FS completion to prevent erosion and transport of contaminated sediments by the Flathead River and was performed in accordance with the USEPA-approved Removal Work Plan.<br/><br/>The PRP has an ongoing community outreach program and, in consultation with the EPA and state partners, provides the community with information to reduce exposures to potentially contaminated sources. The PRP has implemented a robust community involvement program to communicate risk about the site. The PRP has been proactive in coordinating community involvement support with EPA. The PRP has a website that is updated regularly with information on the Site and status of the project (https://www.cfacproject.com/). The PRP also provides a monthly newsletter to the community with project updates and holds update meetings for the community and Columbia Falls City Council on a frequent basis.   <br/>"

The Sand Creek site is a deleted site from the NPL; however, EPA conducts statutory five-year reviews.  During the Sixth Five-Year Review a screening evaluation was conducted for vapor intrusion exposure using the EPA Vapor Intrusion Screening Calculator (VISL).

To date, EPA and the Colorado Department of Environmental Health (CDPHE) are working on developing a plan to collect a limited number of soil gas samples near the monitoring well URS-1 that’s close to a building at OU4.  Based on groundwater data collected at the site vapor intrusion appears to be limited to only one well location.

Based on available data for the waste rock piles demonstrating high concentrations of arsenic and lead, occupants of homes in the Site could be experiencing unacceptable exposures.<br/><br/>To date, remedial activities at this state-lead Site involve treatment of contaminated surface water and removal or capping of tailings and waste rock piles. In addition to the existing Argo water treatment plant on the main stem of Clear Creek, EPA and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) completed a second water treatment plant on North Clear Creek in March 2017, which is designed to address heavy metal contamination in that tributary. Remedial activities to date have addressed unacceptable human exposures from surface water and the previously identified tailings and waste rock piles. There are a limited number of residences (primarily in Central City) that have been constructed near mine waste rock piles subsequent to completion of the remedial investigation and previously completed response activities. The CDPHE and EPA have designated Operable Unit 5 to characterize and address risk posed by the waste rock piles located on or near residential properties. The Agencies have developed and are implementing a plan for further site characterization, community outreach and review of available blood lead data collected by local health agencies. To date, consent for access to conduct removal actions has been obtained for a small number of properties where data shows concentrations of lead or arsenic in waste rock piles pose unacceptable risk.

The OU1 Record of Decision Amendment issued in 2017 selected institutional controls as part of the OU1 remedy. This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because of high concentrations of heavy metals, specifically arsenic and lead, in waste rock piles and groundwater in Belden and Rock Creek.<br/><br/>To date, the planned activities to address this pathway are to coordinate with the State of Colorado and the property owner to implement a restrictive notice via the Colorado Environmental Covenant Statute to restrict access to the Belden and Rock Creek areas of the Site.

Lincoln Park was finalized on the NPL in 1984. Because it was historically managed by CDPHE under a Consent Decree-Remedial Action Plan and Radioactive Materials License, there has not yet been a site-wide evaluation of the human health exposure risks under CERCLA. However, a human health exposure evaluation was completed for OU2 Soils & Sediment and found no unacceptable risk. A ROD was signed for this area in 2002.<br/>EPA uses the HEID Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occuring, and that those exposures are above the acceptable risk-based levels. As of September 2021, the planned activities to collect sufficient information to make a human exposure evaluation are underway. A Human Health Risk Assessment to evaluate human interactions with potentially contaminated media including OU1 and OU3 soil, sediment, groundwater, surface water and air, and OU2 groundwater, is in progress and the results will be included in the Final Remedial Investigation Report. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure determination by September 2024.<br/>To date, EPA suspects that contaminant source areas are within the former Cotter Uranium Mill operations area. Primary contaminants of concern include radionuclides, heavy metals, TCE, and PCBs. The Remedial Investigation to document the site-wide nature and extent of contamination is underway. The risk evaluation team is evaluating the large amount of historic data, the quality of those data, and preparing a data gaps analysis to inform additional sampling. This does not necessarily mean that unacceptable exposures are occuring. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this Site, please contact the EPA Project Manager (Rebecca Gerhart, 303-312-6695) or the EPA Community Involvement Coordinator (Ryan Kloberdanz, 303-312-6078).<br/>The Community Involvement team publishes a quarterly newsletter, holds an annual meeting, and has published several Fact Sheets for homeowners and realtors in the area. This site has an active Community Advisory Group (CAG).

At least three potential soil source areas were recently identified. PFAS are a group of man-made chemicals that includes PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and many other chemicals. The health advisory for drinking water is 70 ppt or 0.07 ug/l. Maximum concentrations in environmental media include: soils up to 3,400 ug/kg; ground water up to 2011 ug/l; and one surface water detection of 112 ug/l. Historic uses of aqueous Fire Fighting Foams are the source of PFAS at the base. The site was previously categorized as Human Exposure Under Control. The concentrations in soil, ground water, and surface water need to be delineated and assessed for potential exposure risks.<br/><br/>EPA uses this Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occuring, and that those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. As of September 2021, the planned activities to collect sufficient information to evaluate this new potential exposure pathway and/or contaminants(s) are to conduct a remedial investigation (RI), which will include a Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) and/or information about the human interactions with potentially contaminated media. The PFAS contaminants may be co-mingled with contaminants in ground water associated with the fourteen established Operable Units (OUs) on the base. One or more new OUs may be established to facilitate response actions.  Direct soil exposure and ingestion of ground pathways must be evaluated. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure evaluation by September 2023. <br/>"

The Cooperative Agreement with the City of Omaha continues through May 2022. The City currently has 243 residential properties remaining to be sampled. The City continues to identify and to reach out to the owners of the 738 residential properties that have been sampled with lead contamination over 400 ppm and have refused remediation. The City has an extensive community outreach program providing lead information to diverse community groups. Through a separate Cooperative Agreement funded by the EPA, the Douglas County Health Department works with local WIC clinics and Head Start programs to evaluate children living within the Omaha Lead site for elevated blood lead levels. The DCHD compiles blood lead level data and reports to the EPA on the number of children tested each quarter. The DCHD also has an extensive outreach program that focuses solely on health care facilities, doctor offices, Head Start programs and WIC outreach programs.

Lead is the main contaminant of concern due to air deposition of contaminants from smokestacks onto the surface of residential yards.  Smelter waste was also used as construction fill material and as a base for driveways, streets, and sidewalks.  Pathways of exposure include inhalation and ingestion of residential soil or smelter waste found in yards, parks, or school properties.

Work has been completed to determine where exposures were occurring.  To date, nine vapor mitigation systems have been installed at the Ogallala Groundwater Contamination Site.  One more was scheduled to be installed at Operable Unit 1, but issues related to property access prevented completion of this task.  Work is currently under way to facilitate installation of a mitigation system at this property.  In addition, the system at one other property was not sufficient in reducing TCE in the indoor air.  Additional evaluation is needed at that property to evaluate whether a significant portion of the TCE is coming from inventory at the property itself.  The additional work at these two properties should be completed by mid-2021.   "

Contaminated soil and sediments pose a direct contact and ingestion threat to young children and pregnant women. The planned activities to address this pathway were a series of removal actions to stabilize waste piles, replace highly contaminated surface soil in residential yards and child high-use areas, and complete two remedial actions to address remaining yard soils (OU 1) and watershed sediments (OU 2). A total of 5,800 yards have been sampled. Of those 4,400 had one or more areas > 400 parts per million lead. A total of 1,873 removals have been completed where high levels of lead were found in residential properties or where children with elevated blood lead were identified. Six of the seven mine waste piles are stabilized. Surface water, sediment, and various forms of biota contain elevated concentrations of lead throughout the mining area. Fish in Big River have shown elevated concentrations of lead. Fish advisories have been in place at the site since 1981. EPA has worked with the St. Francois County Watershed Group, a group of local concerned citizens and other federal and state agencies, to help educate the community on the effects of lead contaminated soil, sediment, and surface water. Additionally, EPA plans to complete a final Record of Decision in October of 2022 to address lead-contaminated floodplain soil, surface water, and sediment in the Big River watershed from Leadwood to the confluence with the Meramec River. The planned activity to address the pathway for OU 1 is the continuation of ongoing removal of lead contaminated soils. Additionally, the planned activities to address the pathway for OU 2 will be determined in the Record of Decision for OU 2.<br/>"

Lead-contaminated residential yard cleanups began in 2000 and are ongoing, several mine waste piles have been addressed and others are in the Remedial Investigation phase and remain to be addressed, and creek, river and lake sediments and floodplains are still contaminated in many areas. The EPA is currently developing a watershed model for the Little Saint Francis River as part of the RI activities to support long-term remedial action for the overall watershed.

A previous investigation had shown high levels of tetrachloroethylene in indoor air, but after several inspections of the plant, it was found that the tetrachloroethylene was coming from a chlorinated degreaser. That product was subsequently removed, and the tetrachloroethylene levels are no longer an issue. Currently, work is being done to mitigate the vapor intrusion in two manufacturing and storage buildings. Additional sampling to asses indoor air concentrations will be completed once those systems have been put into place.<br/>"

The site assessment used soil samples and existing ground water wells to make its determination; however, the Remedial Investigation is addressing any unevaluated soil and ground water areas not addressed in the site assessment by constructing additional monitoring wells and taking additional soil gas, indoor air and ground water samples. The RI is anticipated to be completed in November 2020. Further sampling is proposed for soil gas and indoor air at the dry cleaner and surrounding buildings.<br/><br/>EPA, the State of Texas and local water districts are monitoring the water supply wells. Ground water samples in all private and public water supply (PWS) wells indicate that only two private wells are just above the Maximum Concentration Level (MCL)/health based limit, with all other wells below the MCL. The two affected private wells are no longer in use. One PWS well has concentrations below the MCL; the water district is blending the ground water from this well with another PWS well which has no detectible concentrations. Although the affected PWS concentrations are below the MCL, the blending allows non-detect/clean water to flow to the consumer.<br/>"

In November of 2008, an alternate water supply line was completed and 144 residential and commercial users were connected to a municipal water supply system. A small number of residences chose not to be connected to the municipal supply and may still be exposed to the contaminated ground water. On September 29, 2017, EPA amended the Record of Decision to address two key soil zones, the Shallow Source Area Soil and the Deep Unsaturated Chicot Sand, with vapor-phase contaminant concentrations with the potential to impact the underlying groundwater in the “Shallow Water-Bearing Zone” (“Shallow WBZ”) and the “Deep Chicot Aquifer”. The purpose of the Selected Remedy is to implement a sitewide strategy to reduce the source of contaminants in the soil to the underlying groundwater. EPA ensures community members know about and participate in site issues and activities by conducting community interviews, implementing a community relations plan, briefing local government officials, holding public meetings and/or availability sessions, mailing fact sheets about the site to residents, publishing ads in local newspapers; and assigning an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator to the site to answer community member questions and concerns. Additional community involvement activities will occur throughout the Superfund activities for the site. A door-to-door visit was conducted in November 2019 to encourage the property owners on private wells to sign-up to be on the waterline. After the door to door visit, 21 property owners gave access to sample their wells. These wells were sampled in February 2020 and four of them have site contaminant levels above MCLs. Three of the property owners use the well for lawn watering or shop cleaning purposes and do not use the well for drinking water purposes. One of the property owners process the water through a carbon filtration system before use.  There are other property owners will wells that did not give access to sample their wells.  Follow-up phone calls were made in August 2020 with the property owners to determine their interest to be on the waterline and only 5 of them want to be connected to the waterline."

The EPA completed the dredging of sediment in a half mile section of the canal with the highest concentrations of PCBs in May 2020.  Over time the concentrations of PCBs should begin to decline but this will likely take a number of years.  The EPA will continue to monitor PCB concentrations in sediment and fish tissue.  The EPA will also coordinate with the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) to evaluate the risk from consuming fish caught within the Donna Reservoir and Canal System Superfund Site.<br/><br/>An Institutional Control (IC), in the form of an aquatic life order, has been implemented at the Site for a number of years. The TDSHS issued “Aquatic Life Order Number 9” in February 1994. This order stated that “. . . the Donna Irrigation System [Donna Site] located in Hidalgo County is declared a prohibited area for the taking of all species of aquatic life.” According to a sign posted by the Texas Department of Health, predecessor to the TDSHS, at Donna Lake there is a $500 fine for keeping fish from the reservoir and canal system. This sign also states that, “Warning, it is illegal to possess fish from this water, fish caught from this water may contain harmful chemicals.” The enforcement authority for this order is the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (i.e., Game Wardens). The EPA expects that the TDSHS’s aquatic life order will remain in place until PCB levels in fish tissue are shown to have decreased to a level that is not an unacceptable risk.<br/><br/>Informational Institutional Controls (ICs) include the information distributed by the TDSHS concerning PCBs and the cooking options for fish caught from the Site. This document is titled “Guide on Fish Consumption and the Effects on Human Health” (Publication No. 09-14639, July 2015). To increase the awareness of the prohibitions concerning the taking of fish from the Site, the EPA will install and maintain warning signs for 5 years.  The EPA plan includes enhanced outreach efforts conducted by the EPA, TDSHS, and other entities associated with the Site. These outreach efforts will emphasize that the prohibitions will remain in place after the remediation of the Site until the Remedial Action Objectives identified in the Record of Decision have been achieved.<br/>"

The Feasibility Study is expected to be completed by end of 2021.<br/><br/>Properties of concerned residents were sampled in May/June 2015. Soil data from the residential areas was reviewed to assess the potential for immediate human health risks. All results and concerns were discussed with the residents in October 2015. At this time, no immediate health risks were identified. In addition, properties where refinery waste is present at the surface are fenced and locked to deter trespassing and potential contact with the refinery waste.<br/><br/>In September 2018, a Source Control Interim and Early Action Record of Decision was issued to address the lead additive area and 8 waste source areas.  The remedial design was completed in September 2019 and remedial action was funded in 2020; however, due to travel restrictions related to Covid-19 remediation was not completed in 2021. Until travel restriction are lifted, project start and completion dates are unknown; therefore, expected human exposure under control is unknown.<br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of May 2021, the Tar Creek Superfund Site (Site) is considered Human Exposure Not under Control because people may be exposed to lead in soils, chat piles, chat bases, and mill ponds. Tribal members live throughout the area and utilize plants grown on or animals feeding near contaminated areas as a part of their tribal way of life. In addition to these exposures, there are adolescent recreators and families that continue to trespass and use the contaminated areas for recreational purposes.  The contaminated area is vast and it is not possible to prevent all access to the mining waste.  Consequently the EPA is implementing the cleanup of contaminated source areas and conducting multiple community outreach efforts to educate people with respect to avoiding exposure to the contamination. These actions will significantly reduce the exposure of Tribal members and trespassers to the contamination.<br/><br/>The voluntary buyout the EPA implemented under the Record of Decision for Operable Unit 4 (Mining Waste) in the former mining towns of Picher, Cardin, and Hockerville was completed in 2011. This effort relocated more than 700 residences. With this milestone achieved the continued remediation of residential properties, and the continued outreach efforts in adjacent communities that are within the Site's boundary, the EPA views the exposure to Site contamination to be under control in these areas.<br/><br/>With regard to potential human health risks related to surface water and sediment exposure, EPA is working with partners to address these concerns.  EPA Regions 6 and 7 are working closely with the 3 states (Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas), nine Tribes (Quapaw Nation, Peoria Tribe, Ottawa Tribe, Miami Tribe, Eastern Shawnee Tribe, Wyandotte Nation, Seneca-Cayuga Nation, Modoc Tribe, and Cherokee Nation), and the community to develop and complete a human health risk assessment and characterization report. This Operable Unit 5 (Surface Water and Sediment) effort includes seven watersheds covering approximately 437 square miles and 119 river miles within Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and 8 tribal areas."

This site was one of the first NPL sites and a state highest priority site.\r<br/>\r<br/>With the abandoned refinery there were abandoned tanks, structures, impoundments with contamination, contaminated soils, debris, etc.\r<br/>\r<br/>In the early 1980s, several removal actions took place to pump down the impoundments or lagoons, fence the site, address lagoon levees, etc.\r<br/>\r<br/>In the remediation process, first the impoundments were removed.\r<br/>\r<br/>Later in a second step, a wastewater treatment plant and a soils land treatment unit were built on site in the early 1990s.   \r<br/>\r<br/>By late 1990s and early 2000s, in a third step, the remaining abandoned tanks were removed and contaminated soils were excavated, treated in the land treatment unit, and placed back in the excavation.  Finally the area was graded, capped, seeded and the treatment unit was removed.   \r<br/>\r<br/>Addressing the groundwater was deferred in the original 1984 ROD until later.  In a fourth step, by 2004, new monitoring wells were installed after the previous remedial activities to evaluate the current condition of the groundwater.  (Please note:  by this time soils have been excavated, treated in the land treatment unit and returned to the place of excavation )  For two years, eight rounds of groundwater monitoring were conducted, and the shallow groundwater originally of concern meets now the State of Louisiana RECAP requirements.  No further action will be required for the gw.  The ROD was modified by an Explanation of Siginificant Differences signed on 9/12/2006, and a Final Close Out Report was signed on 9/12/2006.\r<br/>\r<br/>The site is in the construction completion list and a Five Year review will be conducted in 2007.\r<br/>\r<br/>Because the site is adjacent to the Levee of the Mississippi River, the US Army Corps of Engineers have limitations and permit requirements for any activity next to the levees.  The site is also capped, graded, seeded, therefore the State placed a conveyance notification that limits future use to avoid disturbing the cap.  These limit the future reuse potential."

Data from 2011-2015 investigations led by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) have shown that indoor air at certain residences at the site has been contaminated by VOCs above the Ohio Department of Health screening levels. In 2013, the USEPA Removal Program began activities to address the vapor intrusion pathway by sampling at homes and installing vapor mitigation systems in homes where VOCs exceed public health screening level values. In January 2016, Mullins Rubber Products, Inc. agreed to conduct a removal action which includes evaluation and mitigation of residential vapor intrusion and a source control action under USEPA oversight. The removal action is ongoing and expected to continue until a remedy is selected in 2025. The Valley Pike VOCs site was finalized on the National Priorities List (NPL) on September 9, 2016. Currently the USEPA Remedial Program is reviewing plans submitted by Mullins Rubber Products, Inc. for the Remedial Investigation (RI) and Feasibility Study. The RI field work is expected to begin by the end of 2021. There is limited data regarding groundwater contamination from Valley Pike VOCs, and the RI will include a comprehensive groundwater investigation to gather further information. The site is located near the Dayton Mad River Well Field to the south, and the Dayton Miami Well Field to the west. Collectively, these well fields provide drinking water for approximately 400,000 residents in Dayton and Riverside. Both towns' municipalities monitor the wells in their distribution system to ensure that safe drinking water is being provided to the residents.<br/>USEPA prepared a Multi-Site Community Involvement Plan (CIP) to engage and support the community affected by three Superfund sites located in Montgomery County, Ohio. This CIP focuses on the Behr Dayton and Valleycrest Landfill sites in Dayton, and the Valley Pike site in Riverside. See the CIP at: https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/919629. Outreach activities included an informal open house and public meeting, development and distribution of fact sheets for homes within the impacted neighborhood, and interviews regarding the contamination and removal efforts at the site. Since the NPL listing, USEPA representatives have met with the local council members and will continue to actively engage the community through the newly formed Community Advisory Group.<br/>"

EPA evaluated the VI exposure pathway during the remedial investigation. In April 2017, preliminary draft results from sub-slab and/or indoor air sampling indicated exceedances of EPA's VI screening levels and/or removal management levels at both residential and commercial/industrial buildings. Shortly after this discovery, during a May 2017 time-critical removal action, EPA installed vapor mitigation systems at two residential properties where indoor air concentrations exceeded removal management levels. EPA issued an Interim Record of Decision in September 2018 which selected an interim remedial action -- installation of VI mitigation systems -- for 8 known impacted commercial/industrial properties, as well as any other residential or commercial/industrial properties within the VI area of concern at which VI is shown to be occurring.  In Summer 2021, VI mitigation systems were installed at the 8 known commercial/industrial buildings and at 3 additional buildings (1 commercial/industrial and 2 residential) that were identified during the remedial design sampling. However, EPA also needs to test up to 10 remaining buildings (6 commercial/industrial and 4 residential) within the VI area of concern to identify whether VI may be occurring, and then install mitigation systems at those properties if necessary. EPA anticipates that these actions will be completed by Spring 2022."

The site was listed on the National Priorities List in March 2015. EPA started the remedial investigation (RI) at the site in 2016, which included limited surface water sampling. There are several drains and streams that lead off-site and flow into the Detroit River. EPA signed an interim Record of Decision in September 2016 selecting an interim source control remedy addressing leachate from the on-site landfills and the tandem mill ponds. Leachate from the landfills has been shown to contain naphthalene, phenol, mercury, 2,4-dimethylphenol, barium, and cyanide, and currently has a pH greater than 12.5, classifying it as hazardous. Water from the ponds has been shown to contain phenols, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), metals, and high pH. The nature and extent of contamination at the site has not yet been determined, as EPA is still in the early stages of the RI. Additional sampling of groundwater, surface water and sediment was collected over 2018 and continues through summer/fall 2021.  These data are currently being evaluated as received. This additional RI sampling will help determine whether there are any current human exposures to site contamination. A risk assessment will likely be needed to determine whether any identified exposures are within acceptable limits. The site is currently fenced but workers at the nearby mill have access to portions of the site. EPA is in regular contact with the Mayor of Gibraltar regarding the status of the project. EPA will develop a Community Involvement Plan for the site. EPA anticipates having sufficient data from the RI to make a current human exposure determination by the end of 2022."

No one is drinking the contaminated groundwater at the Site. Many houses have been equipped with mitigation systems to prevent inhalation of dangerous levels of indoor air from the vapor intrusion pathway. Additional properties need to be sampled to determine if mitigation systems are necessary to prevent exposures. This sampling is ongoing.

Additionally, EPA believes that PCB-contaminated fish from the Lange and Revere Street canals are being consumed. EPA conducted removal actions in 2014 and 2020 to address 18 properties with PCB concentrations exceeding removal action levels, but approximately 47 other known properties remain with PCB concentrations exceeding remedial action cleanup levels. EPA issued a Record of Decision in September 2018 for residential/commercial properties with contaminated near-surface soils, and EPA completed the remedial design for the 47 properties in January 2021. The remedial action cleanup of these properties is expected to start in 2022. EPA implemented an interim remedial action at the site in summer 2015 which removed highly impacted backfill and bedding materials adjacent to two manhole vaults and the 120-foot concrete pipe beneath Harper Avenue connecting those two vaults within the Ten Mile drain storm sewer system, including removal and replacement of the two manhole vaults and connecting pipe. EPA is currently evaluating cleanup options for the remainder of the site, including the rest of the Ten Mile drain storm sewer system and sediments in the Lange and Revere Street canal. EPA's site-wide human health risk assessment concluded that fish consumption by recreational anglers poses an unacceptable risk to human health. Fish in the Lange and Revere Street canals are contaminated above Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) health-based levels for human consumption due to PCBs, and an MDHHS \"do not eat\" advisory is in place for fish taken from the canals. EPA has observed people ice-fishing and believes the fish are being consumed. PCBs continue to infiltrate into the Ten Mile drain storm sewer system, which empties into the Lange and Revere Street canals connected to Lake St. Clair. The MDHHS periodically sends a mailing to the residents who live along the canals and to local schools, with the \"Eat Safe Fish\" guidelines for Lake St. Clair, and EPA hosts public meetings to provide updates on the progress of the Superfund site and upcoming activities."

WPSC began the remedial investigation (RI) at the site in October 2014 which covers sediment, upland soil, and groundwater. The RI work had been placed on hold, as the potentially responsible party was conducting sediment remediation in conjunction with the Fox River Superfund Site clean up. RI work has resumed and the final RI Report is expected in mid 2022 at which time a determination on the status can be made. The WPSC Green Bay site is the WPSC headquarters and is located in an industrial park surrounded by buildings, parking lots, and a paved walking loop around the perimeter of the rivers' confluence. WPSC maintains the building and paved areas. The former gas plant was demolished and some soil was excavated to build the headquarters and put down the parking lots and paved trail. The groundwater is not the source of drinking water; the confluence of the two rivers up to Lake Michigan is used primarily for commercial shipping purposes and it is not expected to see people use that part of the rivers for recreational purposes other than fishing. In 2014, EPA completed the Community Involvement Plan for the site. There are no nearby residential structures (approx. 0.5 miles away), WPSC owns the site property, and the groundwater plume spans additional corporate offices, parking lots, and a paved river trail outside the corporate complexes. Future outreach activities will be offered to the corporate office workers and local political officials with interest in the cleanup."

Construction workers may be exposed via incidental ingestion of, dermal contact with, and inhalation of particulates and vapors from surface and subsurface soil, and via inhalation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the site while working inside construction trenches. The contaminants include VOCs, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). EPA's September 2017 Record of Decision describes the selected remedy to address these exposure pathways and includes the following: soil vapor extraction (SVE) to treat the VOCs where present in subsurface soil at depths that would make excavation infeasible; excavation of shallower contaminated soil for off-site disposal; and groundwater monitoring until remediation goals are met and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the soil remedy. There is fencing around two of the facilities. One of these two facilities (MTS) is an active business; the other facility is unoccupied. The other active business has no fencing. No institutional controls are in place. There has been no interest from the community regarding the site, however, the public was given an opportunity to comment on the Proposed Plan. The potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are conducting the remedial design through a February 2019 Administrative Order on Consent with EPA. EPA intends to negotiate a separate Consent Decree with the PRPs for performance of the selected remedial action."

In July 2017, EPA and 13 potentially responsible parties (PRPs) signed a settlement agreement known as an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC). The AOC covers the remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) for groundwater at the site. The RI work began in October 2017 and is being conducted in phases, with oversight by EPA and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. In December 2018, EPA approved the PRPs' RI/FS Work plan which included the results from a potable well survey. The survey showed that with only two possible exceptions, all households and businesses located in the area are connected to the public water supply. The private well survey was expanded to the area south of the initial well survey investigation area. Sixteen homes with private wells were identified for potential sampling of their drinking water for analysis of volatile organic compounds. Access attempts to these homes were made by EPA in 2019 and again in late 2020 to sample water this year. In the interim, EPA expects to enter into removal consent agreements with individual PRPs to expedite cleanup of individual source areas identified in the RI that may present unacceptable risks to human health. To date, EPA has entered into consent agreements for removal actions at two separate source-area properties. Vapor intrusion is one of the pathways of concern being investigated and addressed within the industrial park as part of source removal control activities. EPA expects to be able to make a determination about the Human Exposure Control status by June 2023. In 2003, about 800 affected private drinking water wells were connected to the municipal water supply system."

Current known exposure pathways of concern are direct contact with soils in residential, public and industrial areas, and direct contact with soils on the ASARCO property. A Removal Action completed in 2008 addressed residential properties that had lead contamination above 1,200 parts per million (ppm). Approximately 67 residential properties with lead contamination above 400 ppm were not addressed by the removal action and approximately 200 properties need to be sampled or re-sampled. The Illinois Department of Public Health sent letters to the residents whose properties were sampled, discussing the potential contamination in their yards. Access at the former plant property is restricted via a fence that encloses it but trespassing still occurs. In April 2016 the potentially responsible party discontinued the remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) work at the site due to bankruptcy issues. EPA took over the RI/FS in October 2016 and finalized the RI Report in June 2017 and the FS Report in July 2020.

Contamination at the site was initially discovered in 1996, when a concerned citizen contacted the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with complaints of skin irritation caused by water drawn from a private residential well. IDEM obtained 19 drinking water samples from residential wells and six subsurface soil samples from nearby properties. Volatile organic compounds, including tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene were found in the residential well samples. In five homes, contaminants exceeded the Safe Drinking Water Act Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs). IDEM currently provides point-of-entry carbon filters to the residential homes with wells that had contamination approaching or exceeding the MCLs. While investigations have identified some potential sources of contamination, the origin of the contaminants has not been determined. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) added the North Shore Drive site to the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund sites on September 16, 2014. USEPA initiated a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility (RI/FS) in July 2017. The potential human exposure pathways include ingestion of potentially contaminated groundwater or direct contact with potentially contaminated soils. The RI/FS is expected to be completed by June 2024 at which time sufficient data is expected to be available to determine the human exposure under control status."

Remedial action construction activities at the site are expected to be completed in November 2019, although it may take some time after completion of the cleanup activities for the sediments at the site to reach the selected long-term cleanup level and for fish tissue concentrations to decrease. Community outreach and education has been ongoing as the cleanup progresses."

The M&H facility was historically used primarily for mining and smelting activities and is currently inactive, except for a portion operated by Carus Chemical Company which was never involved in smelting activities. The site includes a large residential area (approximately 5,000 homes) surrounding the former facility. A remedial investigation (RI), which included testing a few hundred of the residential properties, was finalized in 2012. After completing the feasibility study, EPA issued a Record of Decision in April 2017 which selected remedies for all areas of the site. Thousands of properties will need to be tested during the remedial design (RD) to determine which properties require cleanup. EPA started the RD sampling in March 2018, and will conduct the RD and remedial action cleanup work in phases. Given the extent and cost of the required cleanup work, it will be a number of years before the human exposure control status will be considered \"under control.\" During the proposed plan public comment period, EPA held two public meetings and an informational session informing residents of the potential contamination in the residential area. EPA held additional information sessions at the start of the RD in 2018 and again in 2019, and will continue to hold periodic information sessions throughout the project. In addition, EPA has mailed information to residents informing them about safe gardening practices to minimize ingestion of contaminated soil and ways to reduce other exposures to contaminated soil. The RD sampling conducted so far identified several residential properties with soil concentrations exceeding removal management levels. Some of those properties were cleaned up during the summer of 2018 in a time-critical removal action and the remainder will be cleaned up during the remedial action. EPA began the remedial action cleanup work within the residential area of the site in summer 2019 and will continue cleanup work each year until the remedial action is complete."

Additionally, surface soil at the Facility Area property contains concentrations of lead and other metals above likely acceptable levels for trespassers. In 2002 and 2003 a removal action was conducted by the potentially responsible parties to address lead contamination in residential yards, commercial lots, and vacant lots. Some contaminated residential yards were not cleaned up during the removal action because the owners refused access for the cleanup work. In addition, the March 2009 Remedial Investigation Report documents concentrations of metals, including lead, zinc, cadmium, and arsenic, that exceed long-term health-based limits for human exposure in soils in several other residential yards, vacant lots, and alleyways near the site. Owners of contaminated residential property have been informed, via fact sheets, public meetings, and letters, about the contamination and how to reduce exposures. EPA conducted a time-critical removal action in 2018 and 2019 to address some contaminated properties. The cleanup of the remaining contaminated surrounding area properties began in summer 2019 and the cleanup of the Facility Area is expected to begin in summer 2022. The selected remedy includes excavation of contaminated soils from residential yards, vacant lots, and alleyways, along with excavation of contaminated materials at the Facility Area, and consolidation of the excavated materials in an on-site capped consolidation area at the Facility Area. The cleanup work will take several years to complete. "

EPA approved the Engineering Evaluation/Cost Analysis in late 2015. On May 31, 2016, EPA signed an Action Memorandum selecting a remedy for the site addressing the contaminated sediments. Following that, the potentially responsible party signed an administrative order on consent to conduct the cleanup, called a \"non-time critical removal action\". The cleanup began September 2016 and was completed in December 2018. It will take several years following the clean up for the PCB levels in fish to decline. "

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2021, there is insufficient information to determine the site-wide Human Exposure Control Status at the Schroud Property Superfund site. The Schroud Property site was used for disposal of slag from the former Republic/LTV Steel facility located about a mile away and consists of a large, unmaintained waste disposal area approximately 67 acres in size. Soil and waste at the property and in nearby Indian Creek are contaminated with lead, chromium and other inorganic compounds. People may be directly exposed to lead, chromium, and hexavalent chromium in waste, soils, and sediment due to heavy recreational use of the site by trespassers. The planned activities to address this exposure pathway include the implementation of security measures to prevent access to the site. The City of Chicago placed barriers and warning signs around parts of the site to discourage access in the fall of 2019. EPA prepared a Community Involvement Plan (CIP) in August 2020 to engage and communicate risk to the community near the Superfund Site. See the CIP at: http://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/960558. EPA anticipates beginning a time-critical removal action to install additional access restrictions in 2021. Potential actions to address unacceptable risk at the site will be evaluated as part of the upcoming Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study, which is planned to be initiated in Spring 2022."

Fish contaminants of concern are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals, including arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, and zinc. There is a fish advisory in place and numerous signs are posted throughout the area warning against fish consumption; however, fishing has been observed. Fish are taken off-site and likely consumed. During the remedial action, approximately 33,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediments were dredged from the Upper River and approximately 50,000 cubic yards were dredged from the Lower River and Inner Harbor. The remedial action sediment dredging work in the river was completed in December 2012. Monitored natural recovery is the selected remedy for the Middle River. Although the active cleanup work is complete, it will take some time for sediments to reach the selected long-term cleanup level and for fish tissue concentrations to decrease. Fish are sampled annually to monitor levels of PCBs. In addition to the long-term recovery in the river, additional PCB contamination has been found in soils at the former Tecumseh facility. An investigation will be performed in the Fall 2021 or Spring 2022 to determine the extent of the Tecumseh contamination and to evaluate response actions.<br/><br/>"

A human health risk assessment and remedial investigation are expected to be completed by February 2023 at which time sufficient data is expected to be available to determine the Human Exposure Control status. Data gap investigations for floodplain soils, sediments, groundwater, and the Great Miami River are still pending as of February 2021. Fact sheets on vapor intrusion were distributed to onsite businesses prior to the construction of vapor mitigation systems, and were followed by ongoing communication of indoor air and sub slab results."

The activities planned to make the human exposure determination        include a soil vapor intrusion, ambient air investigation and risk assessment, which is underway.  The investigation includes the installation of a new   landfill gas monitoring point, weekly methane monitoring at the Site, and punch bar testing between the landfill gas monitoring wells and the nearby houses.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency expects to be able to complete the soil vapor intrusion and ambient air investigation,     and to make a determination on the site-wide Human Exposure Control status by the end of December 2023."

Five-Year Review Reports completed in 2015 and 2020 concluded that there was insufficient data to evaluate potential vapor intrusion risk for commercial/industrial buildings that are above the contaminated groundwater plume. Under USEPA oversight, the potentially responsible parties have been conducting a vapor intrusion investigation which should be complete by November 2022. Informational mailings and meetings are used to keep the public informed of potential site risks and site cleanup progress."

Groundwater, soil, and soil vapor are contaminated by trichloroethene (TCE), dichloroethene (DCE), and vinyl chloride. The potential human exposure pathways include ingestion of groundwater or soil, and inhalation via the vapor intrusion pathway. In 1983 a Groundwater Health Advisory Area was established by the State and requires all residents and businesses in the Advisory Area be connected to the municipal water supply. Except for a commercial property (currently unoccupied) and one resident (recent sampling of private well shows water meets applicable standards), all were hooked up to the municipal water supply. Remedial actions are underway addressing contaminated groundwater and soil. To determine the Human Exposure Under Control status, further information will be obtained by completing assessments for the vapor intrusion pathway. The vapor intrusion assessments are expected to be completed by 09/30/2022 at which time there should be sufficient information to determine the Human Exposure Under Control status for the site. "

But General Mills stopped work and believes that a nearby site currently being evaluated for potential National Priorities List listing is the source of remaining TCE. MPCA is pursuing legal action against General Mills for noncompliance with the Consent Order. MPCA has been pursuing access with approximately 10 remaining property owners for property affidavits.

Contaminated portions of both areas are fenced to prevent access; however, there is evidence of site trespassing. The State issues regular fact sheet mailings to the local community and periodically holds public meetings to inform the public about continuing risks and cleanup progress. The potentially responsible parties (PRPs) have completed several phases of cleanup under State oversight in both areas. Tar seep cleanup at SLRIDT and sediment cleanup at US Steel are expected to be completed by PRP actions in the coming several years, but the remaining soil cleanup at US Steel is expected to continue until December 2030.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of July 2021, the Tittabawassee River, Saginaw River & Bay Superfund site is considered “Current Human Exposure Not Under Control” because residents and other users of the Saginaw River and floodplain may be exposed through direct contact to dioxin/furan contaminated floodplain soil or through consumption of contaminated fish. The site is very large, and includes about 46 river miles, associated floodplains and portions of Saginaw Bay. Effective in January 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) negotiated a Settlement Agreement with the Responsible Party and the State, and a site investigation is underway. Dioxins (primarily furans) are the primary contaminants of concern and are in the river sediment, banks, floodplain soils, and fish. The Responsible Party is investigating the extent of contamination, and in 2021 completed the “Post-Construction Residual Human Health Risk Assessment for Tittabawassee River Segments 1 through 7” that concluded that current human health risks in and along the Tittabawassee River are within or below USEPA’s acceptable risk range. USEPA will work with the State to evaluate if additional measures are needed to control potential future exposures. The Responsible Party continues to investigate the Saginaw River and Bay and will use that information to conduct a future risk assessment. Since 2007, USEPA has signed fifteen Settlement Agreements with the Responsible Party to implement removal actions that contribute to control of human exposures. Cleanup of sediment deposits and river banks is controlling secondary sources that contribute to bioaccumulation in fish and downstream contaminant transport. USEPA provides funding to local partners to conduct education and outreach to encourage compliance with site-related fish and wild game consumption advisories. Prior to the final cleanup, human exposures at eligible residential and public use properties along the Tittabawassee and Saginaw Rivers have been mitigated by requiring interim exposure controls. In January 2015, USEPA selected a final cleanup plan for the Tittabawassee River floodplain, and executed a Settlement Agreement with the Responsible Party requiring cleanup of properties that exceed site-specific dioxin soil cleanup numbers. Most of the 700+ properties in the 4,500-acre floodplain have been evaluated and more than 100 have been provided a cleanup. The multi-year floodplain cleanup will ensure that all people who contact floodplain soil are protected. Floodplain property cleanups started in 2015 and is are expected to continue through 2022. In 2020 USEPA selected a cleanup plan for residential properties on Middleground Island in the Saginaw River and those cleanups are expected to be begin in 2022. Owners have been provided with interim exposure controls in the meantime. Once the source of contamination, floodplain soil and sediment, has been cleaned up, it will take some time for fish tissue concentrations to decrease."

The fish are contaminated with bioaccumulative compounds (DDT and PBB) at levels that present a risk to human from fish ingestion.  Although fish consumption advisories are in place in the River by the State of Michigan and warning signs are posted; fishing has been observed in the River, and we believe the fish are being consumed.   Site groundwater is contaminated, but the contamination has not reached the city of St. Louis municipal wells.  Contaminated groundwater may be discharging into the Pine River.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Although the Gratiot County Golf Course site was deleted from the NPL in 1983, it was placed back on the NPL in March 2010.  The site is being investigated by the State of Michigan as part of an ongoing investigation for OU1 of the Velsicol Chemical Corp site.  The state released the Investigation Report for OU1 (November 2006) and a subsequent Addendum in January 2009, and the former burn area at the Golf Course Site is included as part of OU1.  The Feasibility Study for the cleanup is currently under development.\r<br/>"

This pathway is related to the volatilization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the subsurface. The contaminants of concern include trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in the soil and the groundwater. The chemicals were used in dry cleaning and manufacturing industries. The sources of the VOCs appear to include solvent tanks, contaminated soils and groundwater. The main exposure pathways of concern include the inhalation of contaminated soil gas or sub-slab vapors that become entrained into buildings (vapor intrusion) resulting in the greatest risks at the site. Via a time-critical removal action initiated in 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has removed the contents of three solvent tanks and installed sub-slab depressurization systems in occupied buildings to address immediate threats. On April 8, 2020, EPA issued a decision document selecting an interim remedy to address the source of the (above mentioned) newly identified risk of exposure. Design and implementation of the selected remedy will proceed as funding is made available."

EPA completed the remedial action at the site in May 1997. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes & Energy (EGLE, formerly the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality) is the lead agency at the site. As part of ongoing operations and maintenance (O&M) activities, EGLE identified an additional possible source area, known as the Wade Electric source area, for which the currently identified potentially responsible party (PRP) is not responsible. EPA has provided funding to EGLE to conduct supplemental remedial investigation (SRI) characterization activities at this potential source area. As part of the SRI, EGLE began the vapor intrusion (VI) investigation in 2019, determined a complete VI pathway and installed a mitigation system on the one building on the former Wade Electric source area. EGLE is continuing its VI investigation in the surrounding residential properties to determine if there are any complete VI pathways and should have sufficient information available for EPA to make a Human Exposure Control status determination by 12/31/2022."

The City of Spring Park and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) mitigated the immediate health risks by constructing an interim VOC treatment system as an \"add-on\" to the current drinking  water treatment facility. MPCA began an investigation in 2014 to identify the source(s) of contamination. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed the site on its National Priorities List (NPL) in May 2018, which will allow it to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to provide information on the extent of contamination at the site and explore options for any needed clean up. EPA will complete the RI/FS; it is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, at which time the Human Exposure Under Control status can be determined. Throughout the RI/FS process, MPCA will be consulted and the public will be kept apprised of investigation findings and cleanup options."

The contaminants of concern (COCs) include trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and vinyl chloride in the groundwater. Additional constituents found in groundwater not previously identified as COCs include isopropylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. In addition, the PCE and TCE degradation byproduct cis-1,2-dichloroethene was detected at concentrations exceeding Maximum Contaminant Levels. The chemicals were commonly used in manufacturing industries. The sources of the VOCs appear to include contaminated soils and groundwater. The main exposure pathways of concern include the inhalation of contaminated soil gas or sub-slab vapors that become entrained into buildings (vapor intrusion) resulting in the greatest risks at the site. Further information will be obtained by taking the following actions: investigate the soil beneath buildings and paved areas to determine if impacted soil may serve as a source to groundwater contamination and vapor intrusion, collect sub-slab and/or indoor air samples as needed to evaluate the vapor intrusion pathway, and complete a vapor intrusion evaluation to determine whether an unacceptable risk to human health is posed. EPA expects to be able to make a determination about the Human Exposure Control status at the Chem Central Site in Fall 2022 once the data has been obtained and the vapor intrusion evaluation has been completed."

There are soils on-site contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), for which soil vapor extraction (SVE) was selected as the remedial action in a 1998 interim Record of Decision. The SVE system was installed and was operating but is currently shut down. A Record of Decision was issued in September 2007 identifying the final remedy for the site to address remaining contamination in site soil, soil vapor, and groundwater. MDEQ discovered significant additional contamination at the site in 2014. Additional data collection is being conducted before the remedial action can move forward. An Explanation of Significant Differences was signed in 2018 and addresses the increase in volume for soil excavation. Data collected to determine if surrounding residences or commercial/industrial buildings have unacceptable levels of indoor vapor intrusion from site-related VOC contamination shows inconclusive results. USEPA will be conducting an additional vapor intrusion investigation and expects to know whether vapor intrusion is a problem by the end of 2022. The community is kept up to date on the site and any potential site risks through mailings of factsheets and public meetings. The data collected from the vapor intrusion investigations was communicated to the specific residents and business owners who were participants."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2021, the Allied Paper Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund Site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because the fish in the river are contaminated above health-based levels for human consumption due to PCB contamination. Although there is a fish advisory for the river, and warning signs posted along the floodplains, there is evidence of subsistence fishing from the river. The warning signs have been vandalized in the past and repaired by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes & Energy. In addition, in the floodplains along several miles of the river there may be PCB-contaminated sediments above health-based limits for direct contact for recreational users. A large portion of this land is owned by the State; there is evidence that this property is used as a recreational area, but it is not practical to fence all the floodplain areas or to keep people out of these areas. EPA has conducted or directed several removal actions in and along the river and expects to continue using its removal authority, in addition to its remedial authority, to reduce human exposures due to these exposure pathways. From 2007-2009, an excavation and dredging removal action was conducted in a portion of the river near Plainwell, MI, and 130,000 cubic yards (CY) of PCB-contaminated sediment was removed. A second removal action in the river near the Plainwell No. 2 Dam area was conducted in 2009-2010 and removed 14,000 CY of PCB-contaminated soil and sediment. A third removal project was conducted in 2011-2013 and removed 23,700 CY of PCB-contaminated sediment from Portage Creek. A fourth removal action in the river near the Otsego Township Dam area began in August 2016 and was completed in August 2018, and removed approximately 33,000 CY of PCB-contaminated soil and sediment. A fifth removal action in the river near the Trowbridge Dam began in April 2020 and is expected to take three years to complete. Approximately 75 additional miles of contaminated river sediments remain to be addressed. A supplemental Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study in the Kalamazoo River is ongoing. In late 2015, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the first river area (Area 1), which includes Portage Creek, and that remedy is currently in the remedial design phase. Investigative activities for Area 2 were completed in 2015 and EPA issued a ROD for Area 2 in September 2017. Investigative activities for Area 3 began in 2012 and were completed in 2016, with a ROD anticipated in late 2021. Investigative activities for Area 4 began in 2014 and were completed in November 2018, with the feasibility study of cleanup alternatives underway. Investigative activities for Area 5 began in 2017 and were completed in 2020. Investigative activities for the entire river will extend until 2030. Public education and outreach will continue as the cleanup progresses at the site. Even after cleanup work is complete, it will take some time for fish tissue concentrations to decline."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2021, there is not sufficient data to determine the site-wide Human Exposure Control status at the Hi-Mill Manufacturing Co. Superfund site because of a newly identified exposure pathway. Industrial/commercial workers at the Raves Construction, Inc. facility may be exposed to contaminants via the inhalation of volatile organic compounds through the vapor intrusion pathway. The contaminants include trichloroethylene (TCE), vinyl chloride (VC) and 1,2-dichloroethylene (1,2-DCE). In September 2019, EPA collected groundwater samples from the onsite monitoring wells. Analytical results indicate a concentration of 156,000 micrograms per liter of TCE in a shallow well adjacent to the building. The property owner voluntarily installed a sub-slab depressurization system (SSDS) in sections of the building however the necessity or effectiveness of SSDS has not been evaluated. The planned activities to address this exposure pathway include evaluating the vapor intrusion pathway and the SSDS system that the property owner installed. These activities are expected to be completed by the end of December 2023 at which time EPA expects to be able to determine the Human Exposure Control status."

(Michigan) site is considered \"human exposures are not under control\" until the completion of the remedy on the former Site plant property. The former Site plant property is fenced but hazardous chemicals remain uncontrolled on-site under an inadequate landfill cap. Hazardous substances that have been released at the Site in soil, sediment and groundwater include dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polybrominated biphenyls, hexabromobenzene, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane and chlorobenzene, among others. In June 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency signed a Record of Decision for the former plant property. While fish tissue data has shown a significant decrease in DDT concentrations as a result of the sediment clean up, fish consumption advisories remain in place for the Pine River fish. Warning signs advising against eating fish are also posted at river access points. The remedial action objectives include prevention of ingestion, inhalation, and direct contact of site-related contaminants of concern in soil and groundwater to human and ecological receptors. At the former plant property, the two largest contaminated areas are referred to as Areas 1 and 2. The following remedy implementation is in process: in situ thermal treatment of Area 1  is complete; in situ thermal treatment for Area 2 is expected to be complete by December 2021. The remedial design for the excavation and off-site disposal of 100,000 tons of contaminated soil (Potential Source Areas 1 & 2) is complete and it is expected that this phase of the cleanup will begin in 2022 and be complete in 2024. A number of pre-design investigations are underway and include groundwater modeling for a groundwater pump and treatment system, pre-design for using in-situ chemical oxidation at an area on the site, pre-design investigation for a groundwater collection trench, pre-design for the installation of a vertical barrier wall surrounding the 52-acre site, the construction of a groundwater pump and treatment system, and the construction design of an engineered cap. The community is kept up to date on the site and any potential site risks through mailings of factsheets, and holding public meetings and availability sessions.  The Pine River Superfund Citizens Task Force have received a Technical Assistance Grant."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of March 2021, there is insufficient information to determine the site-wide Human Exposure Control status at the Gary Development Landfill Superfund Site. In 2014, EPA and the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) signed an Administrative Order on Consent for a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS). The PRPs began the on-site field investigation activities in the spring of 2016 and installed a gate and signs along the southern portion of the site in June 2016 to prevent access. However, people can still access the site along the north and east boundaries where potential evidence of trespassing was observed and “no trespassing” signs were posted. The Indiana State Department of Health currently has a \"do not eat\" fish consumption advisory in place for the Grand Calumet River. However, people could be exposed to contaminants in the river (from this site and other nearby pollution sources) if they fail to heed the advisory and eat contaminated fish or contact contaminated sediments. It is unknown how much this site is contributing to the need for the fish consumption advisory. The human health risk assessment evaluated exposure routes (i.e., direct contact, ingestion, inhalation) to potential receptors including maintenance/outdoor workers, construction/utility workers, site trespassers and off-site recreational users of the river. The majority of the risk identified was primarily associated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminated sediments in the northern pond and southern wetland. There is a potential risk to site trespassers and recreational users of the river who may come into contact with contaminated sediments through direct contact. EPA anticipates having sufficient information to make a human exposure determination by May 2025 as part of the selected remedy for the site."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of April 2021, there is not sufficient information available to determine the site-wide Human Exposure Control status at the Fisher-Calo Superfund Site because of an identified potential exposure pathway for vapor intrusion (VI). The main contaminants of concern (COCs) include trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethene (PCE), chloroform and vinyl chloride. A VI investigation work plan was approved and field investigations began in 2016. Seven (7)rounds of seasonal VI investigations have taken place in multiple buildings at the Site through March 2020 in three(3)areas of the Site (One Line North, One Line South & Two Line North.) The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA)and the State have requested additional sampling to further delineate seasonal VI trends. However, the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) have not agreed.<br/><br/>EPA agrees with the PRPs that, to date, most of the sampling results indicate that the COCs do not exceed the VI screening levels in most of the buildings tested. Besides what is discussed below, COC concentrations in indoor air and ambient air samples were below levels of concern or not detected above the laboratory reporting limit. However, EPA does not agree that seasonal trends have been fully established. Also, concerns exist based on the results of the seasonal VI samples collected to date which demonstrate that sub-slab samples in multiple buildings (although some are currently vacant) greatly exceed the Commercial/Industrial VI Screening Levels (VISLs) for the same VOCs found in indoor air (i.e., TCE, PCE & chloroform). The PRPs contend also that chloroform is the only Site VOC detected in indoor air samples above the default screening level in several industrial use buildings. The PRPs further contend that the elevated concentrations of chloroform is in indoor air is attributed to the current industrial operations (an indoor background source) or possibly laboratory interferences. However, these contentions have not yet been accepted by EPA and one building contains office spaces which may require a different attenuation factor than is allowed in regular commercial/industrial settings. The PRPs have opined that ten (10) buildings have been screened out from further VI evaluation and two buildings will require future monitoring based on elevated sub-slab concentrations. Those buildings are in Building 1 located at One Line North, indoor air monitoring should be conducted every five (5 )years during summer worst-case conditions; and in Building 1 located at One Line South, indoor air monitoring should be conducted in three discrete areas on a biennial schedule during summer worst-case conditions unless the use of a currently vacant building changes which may then trigger additional sampling. Discussions are on-going with the PRPs and thus a determination for whether HEUC has been achieved can not be made. <br/><br/>A determination on the site-wide Human Exposure Control status is expected by the end of 2023."

About half of the sampled properties had lead levels exceeding the 400-ppm selected cleanup level. USEPA contacted those residents whose yards were sampled and informed them of their lead levels. USEPA provided guidance to everyone whose property was sampled regarding how to reduce their risk of lead exposure and has repeatedly shared this guidance at public meetings for the site. USEPA selected a remedy for OU1 in a November 2012 Record of Decision. The selected remedy for OU1 includes excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils. USEPA's Remedial Design work is complete in Zones 2 and 3 of OU1. USEPA has also completed remediation work at all properties in Zones 2 and 3 that require remediation, with the exception of 4 properties which will be remediated during the 2021 construction season. USEPA issued a modified remedy in 2020 for Zone 1. Remedial design and remedial action in Zone 1 are anticipated to begin before December 2021 and be completed by the end of 2022. USEPA will continue to inform residents about the status of the site and sampling data, as it becomes available."

Superfund Site because of a newly identified possible vapor intrusion exposure pathway through soil gas. The activities planned to make the Human Exposure determination include the completion of an updated vapor intrusion investigation in a residential area adjacent to the Cam-Or Inc. Site. The initial phase of this investigation identified benzene, vinyl chloride, and 1,2 dichloroethane above the vapor intrusion screening level for each contaminant. Additional soil gas samples (SGP 5, SGP 6, SGP 7, and SGP 8) and indoor air samples must be collected at one of the residences to determine whether there is a complete vapor intrusion pathway. Currently, there are access issues which are preventing the completion of this investigation. The potentially responsible parties have communicated with the property owners regarding obtaining access to the property. The property owners declined access at the time and that they would grant access at some time in the future. There are no new community outreach activities planned at this time other than to provide the First Five-Year Review Report upon completion in 2021."

Exposure to contaminated groundwater is currently controlled via a municipal ordinance.

Removal actions were completed at nine of the areas and remedial actions were completed at six of the areas. Current human exposures are under control in these fifteen areas. EPA prioritized the cleanup of those sites because they are in more densely populated areas. The one remaining area, NPL-8 (Frontage Property/Landfill), is designated as \"Current Human Exposures Not Under Control\" because of the potential for exposure via direct contact, ingestion and/or inhalation to trespassers, construction workers, and/or commercial/industrial workers to radium contaminated soils. Remedy implementation at the NPL-8 Frontage Property has also been completed as of August 2020 2021. EPA has not implemented the remedy at NPL-8<br/>Landfill. The timing for implementation of NPL-8 Landfill remedy is dependent on the availability of state funding for their 50% cost share. Site security measures are in place with NPL-8 surrounded by a fence. Periodic inspections show that the structural integrity of the fence is in good condition andthere is no evidence of trespassing. NPL-8 is covered with a dense vegetation. No soil disturbances have been observed at NPL-8."

The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) initiated a Public Health Assessment in April 2017. As of January 2021, ATSDR indicated that they need more data to complete their assessment and are waiting to receive Phase I sampling results. EPA anticipates sharing Phase I data with ATSDR by summer 2021.

Samples were collected from 41 out of 814 properties, including garden areas at 14 properties. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in June 2017 for portions of OU4 that requires excavation of metals-contaminated soils at residential properties, parks, and alleys. At the request of Illinois EPA, U.S. EPA assumed the role of lead agency in October 2019. EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to the OU4 PRPs to implement the 2017 ROD. Remedial Action began in July 2020 and will continue until all properties that require remediation have been remediated. An interim remedy was completed at OU1 in the early 2000s and OU2 has recently been capped in accordance with Illinois EPA landfill regulations. OUs 3 and 5 are currently in undergoing Remedial Investigation (RI) and the RI reports are expected to be complete by 12/31/22. The Remedial Investigation in OU6 will begin following the conclusion of the residential sampling in OU4. To inform the public of potential risks at the site, a Citizens Advisory Group meets regularly to keep the public informed of issues related to the site. Public meetings and availability sessions have been held by U.S. EPA, and several fact sheets and mailings have also been distributed throughout the community. Ongoing community outreach includes public meetings and informational mailings. "

EPA conducted lead bioavailability testing during the summer of 2017. While doing so, EPA identified several properties, including those with sensitive populations, with lead concentrations exceeding EPA’s removal management levels. EPA conducted a time-critical removal action at 10 properties during the fall of 2017. EPA has conducted extensive outreach to inform the community about site status and how to mitigate the risks posed by lead-contaminated soil through public meetings and the dissemination of informational sheets developed with ATSDR. EPA expects to issue the Record of Decision by the end of 2021 to select a remedy to address the lead-contaminated soils. It will take several years after issuance of the ROD to complete the remedial design and remedial action cleanup work."

Fish tissue samples will continue to be taken over time to assess remedy protectiveness. <br/><br/>2. OMC Plant 2 (Operable Unit 4):  USEPA completed demolition of the OMC Plant 2 facility. The abandoned facility, contaminated beach sand and sediment, and PCB-contaminated soil have been substantially removed and disposed off-site.<br/><br/>The harbor sediment clean up level has been achieved and the soil clean up is substantially complete. Fish data is showing a declining trend of PCBs. Additional fish monitoring data is needed to confirm the trend, whether reducing the fish advisory is supported, until the PCB level in fish is such that a fish advisory is no longer needed. The activities planned to make the HE determination include: ongoing periodic sampling of fish for PCBs. Fish advisories remain in place; public outreach includes periodic update briefings to the local Community Advisory Group and other local citizens groups to inform the public of potential site related risks and cleanup progress.

The following six volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified as COCs in groundwater: 1,1,1,-trichloroethane, chloroform, tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), vinyl chloride and benzene. These six VOCs were identified as COCs in vapor, based on soil vapor, sub slab, and indoor air screening although only two of these, TCE and PCE, were confirmed to have a complete vapor intrusion pathway. A Record of Decision for Interim Action was finalized in September 2014 and provides for municipal water supply connections to all residents on groundwater within the plume area and provides for installation of vapor intrusion mitigation systems to individual homes with a complete pathway for vapor intrusion exposure. A Consent Decree with the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) was entered on March 29, 2016 to complete the municipal water hookups to, and install vapor mitigation systems in homes in the main groundwater plume area and vapor intrusion zone. The municipal water connections have been completed. Vapor intrusion confirmation sampling is being conducted as access to residences is provided, and mitigation systems are being installed where needed. Vapor mitigation system installation is currently delayed due to COVID-19 concerns. Public outreach and education will continue as the cleanup progresses. "

The remedial action will focus on the excavation of contaminated soil above 360 parts per million. The EPA is continuing to prioritize the clean-up of high-risk properties that had children observed playing in the yards. The site was listed on the National Priorities List in September 2018. The clean-up of all properties with lead above the clean-up goal will be addressed through the ongoing clean-up action."

The Lonnie C. Miller Park represents a significant percentage of the Site’s remedial footprint. Remedial activities for this portion of the Site are anticipated to begin in January 2022. To date, over 625,000 tons of ash-contaminated soil has been removed from 1,625 parcels. Eighty nine parcels (including the Lonnie C. Miller Park) have not been remediated because either (1) access to the parcel was not granted; or (2) the contaminated soil is contained beneath an impervious surface or is physically not accessible. Temporary engineering controls, which include fencing, signage, and vegetative covers, have been implemented to supplement the remedial efforts. In considering the remedial activities that are anticipated to be conducted in 2022, the human exposure indicator for the Jacksonville Ash Superfund Site will continue to be \"not under control\". The EPA is planning to distribute remedial update newsletters to the community before December 2021.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2021, the Macon Naval Ordnance Plant site is considered Insufficient Data to Determine Human Exposure Control status because site workers could be exposed to contaminated site soil, groundwater, and indoor air.  Contaminants of Potential Concern include trichloroethylene (TCE) and other Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). EPA has negotiated with the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) to perform the Remedial Investigation (RI) and Feasibility Study (FS), which will include a Human Health Baseline Risk Assessment.  The RI/FS began in October 2019 and is expected to be completed in 2022.  In 2015 and 2016, EPA found unacceptable levels of TCE in indoor air at two buildings on the site.  At that time, EPA worked closely with the business owners to implement engineering controls that successfully mitigated TCE concentrations in air to safe levels for site workers. However, in January 2020, unacceptable levels of TCE was again found in one of these buildings, and as of September 2021 additional measures are being taken to mitigate those TCE levels, including installation of a sub-slab depressurization system. Data is being collected to determine if all human exposure pathways have been evaluated.  EPA has prepared a Community Involvement Plan, and provides updates and other information about the site with the community. On November 12, 2019, a joint public availability session was held that addressed both the Macon Naval Ordnance Plant and Armstrong World Industries sites."

Removal activities consisted of excavation of soil and sediment contaminated with Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in the Highland Industries property, a segment of the nearby ditch (approximately 1900 feet long), a section of the ditch adjacent to Pecan Dr., and Huckleberry Park. There is insufficient data to determine the human exposure site status because no comprehensive evaluation of the human health exposure pathway has been conducted yet.

Sources of TCE contamination to groundwater have resulted in three major plumes at PGDP including the Northeast and Northwest plumes that are the largest in the DOE Complex, extending off-site to the Ohio River. DOE has established a multi-decade phased approach under the Federal Facility Agreement (FFA) to the investigation and remediation of the known source areas in the Plant Industrial Area with Remedial Action Completions targeted in FY2031 (C400 Complex OU) and FY2052 (Southwest Plume Sources). Additional sources are suspected to underlie buildings and groundwater modeling indicates additional TCE sources may exist within the Plant footprint:  the Potential Additional Groundwater Sources remedial investigation and source(s) cleanup is targeted for the FY2042-2048 timeframe. <br/><br/>Given the DOE’s multi-decade phased approach to the identification, characterization and mitigation of TCE sources to groundwater contamination, EPA requested (March 2018) scoping and implementation of a programmatic effort to evaluate the vapor intrusion pathway in those areas of the Plant that overlie the massive TCE plumes, with a focus on areas where workers are present and will continue to be present for the foreseeable future and areas where new building construction is proposed.  Resolution of DOE’s invocation of dispute regarding EPA’s request requires DOE to complete a Plant Industrial Area Vapor Intrusion Preliminary Risk Assessment project (Memorandum of Agreement for Resolution of Formal Dispute Concerning Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection Nonconcurrence and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Conditions Submitted on the Site Management Plan, Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Paducah, Kentucky, Annual Revision-Fiscal Year 2018, DOE/LX/07-2418&D2:  Effective Date March 29, 2019).  DOE’s draft Report (targeted for FY2021) must specify whether any additional actions are necessary to satisfy the question of potential threat to human health from vapor intrusion and/or to bring human exposure to vapor intrusion under control. The Environmental Indicator for Human Exposure Under Control should remain “insufficient data” until EPA and the Commonwealth of Kentucky have either concurred on the Report or either party has requested Additional Work (FFA Section XIX) that, per the MOA, may include Remedial Investigation, Removal Actions and Early (remedial) Actions to address Plant Industrial Area vapor intrusion concerns. <br/>"

This site was listed on the NPL in January 2018. A remedial investigation began in the Fall of 2020 to determine the nature and extent of contamination at the approximately 107-acre plant property (OU1). The OU1 remedial investigation is scheduled to be completed in the Spring of 2022. Additional remedial investigations for the east and west gypsum stacks and adjacent water bodies (Bayou Casotte and Grand Bay Estuary) are scheduled to begin by Winter of 2022. Concurrently, a Non-Time Critical Removal is being conducted to cap the large east gypsum stack (OU2) which is the source of significant surface water contamination. Primary contaminants are metals and acidity (pH) in surface water and groundwater.<br/><br/><br/>"

At Site 45 groundwater contaminated with volatile organic compounds is entering the storm water system pipes and manholes where it travels down the pipes to the outfall which empties into the marsh. There is insufficient data to determine if workers who may enter the manholes would be exposed to unacceptable levels of contamination in the air and water. Resolution of this issue has been under dispute, however an agreement on a path forward has been reached. The Navy has agreed to seal the storm water drains and/or manholes to prevent intrusion of contaminated groundwater from Site 45. Once sealed and flushed, the manholes and pipes would no longer contain contaminated groundwater from Site 45. Therefore, there would be no need for additional air data or monitoring. As of May 10, 2021 the Site 45 ROD requiring this remedial action is complete. The RD and RAWP are in progress. The remedy component sealing the storm sewers will need to be completed before status of the HE indicator can be reconsidered.  However, please remember there are still about 18 sites remaining at MCRD where HE may not be under control or insufficient data exists to make a determination. Progress has been made at a significant number of these potential sites.  However, they may continue to impact the EI determination even after Site 45 is remediated."

EPA is continuing to make progress on the site-wide remedial investigation and risk assessment.  A ROD addressing residential properties (OU-2) that may have been impacted from potential migration from the former manufacturing facility via the stormwater ditch systems during heavy rain events was issued in 2020 and cleanup activities in the selected properties are on-going.  Additional sampling is required to address data gaps that have been identified to fully determine nature and extent of contamination. Potential exposure pathways that may require further investigation include direct contact from contaminated soil on-site and from contaminated sediment in storm water ditches in adjacent neighborhoods. Many of the outstanding data gaps are expected to be addressed in the ROD addressing the (Former Main Facility OU-3 and OU-5), which is currently scheduled to be issued before September 2022.  A site-wide human health risk assessment is expected to be completed in FY2022.  The public has been informed through public meetings, Zoom calls and periodic fact sheets to provide updates of the site status and upcoming activities.  Once COVID-19 travel restrictions are reduced, the EPA expects to resume providing updates and other site related information through regular meetings with the community.<br/>"

The levels of methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (primarily Aroclor 1268) detected in fish fillets resulted in a fish consumption advisory for the Turtle River/Brunswick Estuary issued by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources from 1995 to the present. EPA issued the cleanup plan for the marsh (Operable Unit 1) in September 2015, is currently conducting the remedial design (expected completion in 2021) and expects to begin the remedial action in 2023. EPA will continue to advise that fish at the site should not be consumed. EPA has prepared a Community Involvement Plan, and provides updates and other information about the site through regular meetings.<br/><br/>"

A site wide Record of Decision (ROD) was signed in September 2017.  The residential exposure units are triggered into CERCLA action by EPA’s HI=1 of 50 parts per trillion (ppt).  In each exposure unit, the residential yards will be cleaned up to FDEP’s Soil Cleanup Target Level (SCTL) of 7 ppt.  The Remedial Design was completed in September 2019.  Funding for the Remedial Action is pending. Once funding is provided, the remedial action could be completed within three years.  EPA has prepared a Community Involvement Plan, and provides updates and other information about the site through regular meetings.<br/><br/>"

Portions of the visual asbestos has been removed, however, the remaining surface, subsurface and invisible asbestos has yet to be characterized. Onsite developers, maintenance workers, trespasser could be exposed. The current process toward final cleanup has been stalled due to a dispute between the EPA and Army on acceptable actions to meet the CERCLA cleanup program. Final asbestos cleanup would likely require 2-3 years after resolution of the dispute."

EPA plans to complete the cleanup of the residential properties in the summer of 2021.  EPA has worked closely with the community to develop a Community Health and Safety Plan which provides recommendations and advice to minimize exposures in a practical way prior to EPA completing the residential soil cleanup.  EPA has completed the relocation of several onsite businesses, although one is still ongoing.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of March 2022, there is insufficient information to determine the site-wide Human Exposure Control status at the Fort Detrick Area B Groundwater (Fort Detrick) Superfund Site. This does not necessarily mean that unacceptable exposures are occurring. Fort Detrick was proposed to the National Priorities List (NPL) on September 3, 2008 as part of the NPL Proposed Rule #49 (73 FR 51393). Four Source Areas were identified at Fort Detrick in the NPL proposal including: (1) Chemical Waste Disposal Pits - Area B-11; (2) Area B-2 Landfill; (3) Area B-Grid and (4) Area B 20 South Burn Area. Other possible source areas identified in the NPL proposal narrative include 30 additional areas that require investigation. The volatile organic compounds (VOC) trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE) are the major chemical constituents detected in ground water. Additionally, TCE also was detected in a residential well located on the southern portion of Shookstown Road. In September 2005, two ground water samples collected from residential wells contained TCE or PCE at concentrations meeting the criteria for documenting Level I actual contamination. Therefore, groundwater contamination may extend off site to residential wells. In 2006, the Army provided bottled water to five residences located along Kemp Lane due to detections of low levels of PCE and TCE in groundwater. Subsequently, these five residences have been connected to a public water supply by the Army. A Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) between the U.S. Army (Army), the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), and EPA was finalized in 2010. The FFA describes the procedures under which the Army, MDE, and the EPA will investigate and, if necessary, remediate sites at Fort Detrick in accordance with CERCLA. VOCs are present in the karst aquifer that underlies Area B of Fort Detrick. The most notable VOCs are PCE, TCE, and chloroform that emanate in a dissolved plume from Area B-11, a former water disposal area located in the western portion of Area B. The Army performed a removal action at the B-11 site from 2001 to 2004 to remove suspect intact drums from the landfill. In 2009, the Army signed a Decision Document which selected capping of the known inactive disposal areas at Area B, including the B-11 disposal area. The capping remedial activity was completed in 2010. Currently, the contaminated groundwater plume is under investigation, with a Remedial Investigation Work Plan approved at the end of 2010. Ongoing sampling of the groundwater has determined that a portion of the VOC plume has migrated off-site south towards private property adjacent to Area B. This property is commonly referred to as Waverly View. In the recent past, the Waverly View property owner denied the Army continuous access to Waverly View for the purpose of sampling groundwater to determine the extent of the groundwater plume migration. Thus, the extent of the VOC contaminant plume migration south of Area B is unknown. The Army has recently obtained access from the Waverly View property owner and has begun installation and sampling of some groundwater monitoring wells to determine the nature and extent of the plume's migration off-base and the potential vapor intrusion risk to future residents."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "The Big John Salvage Superfund site is considered Current Exposures Controlled since all current completed exposure pathways fall within the acceptable risk range.  The pre-final draft human health risk assessment indicates that the only exposure route outside the secured area which may present an unacceptable risk to people would be recreational users of the Monongahela River, which is adjacent to the site, coming into contact with deep sediments contaminated with coal tar residues, including carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (CaPAHs).    Potential contact with deep sediment (>1feet) is considered under a future use scenario as local developers are considering construction of a marina along the river bank.  As of November 2007, EPA removed contaminated sediment from the tributary and installed a seep collection system to prevent contamination from moving further.  EPA is currently completing an investigation to determine what additional work should be conducted.  EPA issues fact sheet updating the community on site progress in September 2006 and has assigned a Community Involvement Coordinator to answer community member questions and concerns.\r<br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of March 2021, the Culpeper Wood Preservers, Inc. Superfund site is currently considered Human Exposure Not Under Control. This site is an active wood treating facility located in Culpeper, VA.  Historic use of chromated copper arsenate (CCA) to produce pressure treated lumber has impacted various media at the site.  The use of CCA was discontinued in 2002 and the facility has since used other preservative methods.  Currently, surface soil contamination consisting of metals (primarily arsenic and hexavalent chromium) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) poses a potential exposure pathway to human receptors.  Portions of this surficial soil contamination have since been paved to reduce risk.  Nearby private wells have also been impacted by arsenic and chromium and are being provided with bottled water to mitigate risks associated with groundwater ingestion. In January 2020, EPA entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (ASAOC) with the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP), whereby the  PRP will perform a removal action to connect impacted properties to a waterline. The PRP's Preliminary Concept Plan was approved by the Town in February 2021. The PRP's contractor will be visiting the impacted properties to collect information regarding subsurface structures/utility lines and will then develop the waterline design."

The surface soil at the upland portion of the site meets the clean-up level for carcinogenic polynuclear aromatics (cPNAs) EPA expects to adopt in a future decision document.  The sediments in the flood plain of Massaponax Creek were previously excavated and disposed of off-site.  However, EPA cannot be assured that the sediments have not become re-contaminated because neither the subsurface soil nor the ground water in the upland area were remediated.  Although a fence was constructed, it cannot completely encircle the site because there is an active railroad siding traversing the site,  As such, trespassers could be exposed to unacceptable levels of cPNAs.  The activities planned to make the Human Exposure Control determination include: re-sampling of the flood plain sediments in the Spring of 2012, and implementing any necessary remedial actions after the Decision Document is finalized. The results of the investigations will enable EPA to make a Human Exposure determination for the site and to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to control exposures, if necessary.  "

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of March 2021, there is insufficient information to make a site-wide Human Exposure Control status determination at the North Penn - Area 5 Superfund site. The Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) is performing a vapor intrusion (VI) investigation in the onsite structure at OU2. Initial results indicate that there are elevated concentrations of VOCs in the sub-slab and at concentrations near action levels in indoor air, but concentrations are variable. Additional sampling is necessary to assess the seasonal variability of the potential vapor intrusion. This building is currently minimally staffed pending sale. <br/><br/>Additionally, EPA issued two UAOs in 2017: 1) to perform a Pre-remedial Design Investigation which seeks to delineate the contamination at OU1, and 2) to perform a Phase I bedrock groundwater Remedial Investigation (RI) at OU2. The work under both UAOs seeks to define the extent of contamination and potential human exposure pathways. Without delineation of groundwater contamination and potential human exposure pathways, there is insufficient data to determine human exposure."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "The Palmerton Zinc Superfund site is considered Current Human Exposures Controlled because of site progress and site condition changes evaluated during the most recent five year review (09/28/2007).  Specifically, reevaluation of residential properties with lead contaminated soil under Operable Unit 3 found that shortly after the ROD was issued (10/09/2001), the Real Estate Seller Disclosure Law (Pa. C.S.A. §§ 7301 - 7315) became effective in Pennsylvania.  This law provides that sellers of residential property must disclose any material defects with the property known to the seller prior to the signing of an agreement of sale with respect to the property.  Material defects are defined to specifically include the presence of hazardous substances on the property.  The Real Estate Seller Disclosure Law also places an affirmative duty on the agent representing the seller to advise the seller of his responsibilities under the law and to provide the seller with a copy of the disclosure form required by the law.  A seller who does not disclose a material defect, such as the presence of hazardous substances on the property, is liable for the actual damages suffered by the buyer as a result of that failure.  Therefore, EPA has determined that no further action regarding implementation of institutional controls in connection with Operable Unit 3 is required.   However, the remedial investigation/feasibility study for Operable Unit 4 needs to be completed and a remedy selected and implemented before the Site can be considered construction complete.  The Operable Unit 4 ROD is planned for 2009. \r<br/>\r<br/>"

The Proposed Remedial Action Plan (August 2020) discusses the Preferred Remedial Action Alternatives for the different areas of concern in Operable Unit 1. To specifically address the lead that poses a human health risk, EPA is proposing a combination of excavation and disposal of soils and sediment contaminated with lead, as well as the addition of amendments in the form of in situ stabilization to reduce the toxicity of lead in the environment. Additionally, the use of Institutional Controls will reduce or eliminate current exposure pathways.<br/>"

The responsible parties are performing a Feasibility Study for the Site and it is scheduled to be complete by March 2022.  Currently, surface and subsurface soil contamination consisting of metals (primarily lead) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)  pose a potential exposure pathway to human receptors.   A removal action removed lead and PCBs from surface soils on portions of the residential properties to remove risk but soil contamination continues to pose a potential exposure pathway to human receptors on the residential properties."

In addition to addressing the contaminated sediments in the Canal, the planned activities to address this pathway include working with the state to ensure fish consumption advisory signs are posted, to clean up some of the former industrial sites along the canal’s banks, reduce sewage overflows, and improve water quality.  <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise. A Community Advisory Group (CAG) comprised of members representing diverse interests in the community has been established to disseminate site information and solicit public comments on project activities.<br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of June 2021, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Area - Vieques Superfund Site is considered \"Human exposure not under control\" due to extensive amounts of unexploded ordnance. The site includes certain areas of the island of Vieques and nearby waters that have become contaminated by munitions and explosives of concern, primarily by United States Department of Defense (DoD) activities. From the 1940s until 2003, the US Navy administered lands on both the western and eastern ends of Vieques Island. The lands were used for military training and operations (ship-to-shore gun fire, air-to-ground bombing by naval aircraft, Marine amphibious landing, or combinations), and to store munitions for Atlantic Fleet training. Extensive amounts of unexploded ordnance and remnants of exploded ordnance have been identified in the range areas of Vieques, and in the surrounding waters. The Navy is currently conducting removal of surface munitions and explosives of concern in the impact area in east Vieques. These actions need to be coordinated with additional remedial investigation work to evaluate the nature and extent of contamination. Currently, hazardous substances that may be present at the site have not been fully characterized, but may include mercury, lead, copper, magnesium, lithium, perchlorate, TNT, depleted uranium, PCBs, solvents, and pesticides. As areas being addressed under the time critical removal action are completed, the Navy has initiated remedial investigation(s)/feasibility studies to define the nature and extent of the contamination. A wide area assessment to assist in the planning of the remedial investigation of underwater munitions was recently completed and scoping of the RI has begun. EPA and the Navy ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and frequently updating fact sheets. A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site. Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of June 2021, the Matteo & Sons, Inc. Superfund Site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" due to current exposure pathways to the battery casing waste and impacted soil in the residential yards. <br/><br/>The OU1 portion of the site is located on an approximately 80-acre property containing an active scrap metal recycling facility, a junkyard, and an inactive landfill. Woodbury Creek borders it to the west, Hessian Run to the north, and a residential trailer park to the south. Sources of contamination on the site include an approximately 224,000-square-foot pile of crushed battery casings, an approximately 260,000-square-foot inactive landfill in the north-central portion of the site, and lead- and PCB-contaminated soil located throughout the property. The company deposited crushed battery casings directly into Hessian Run and the wetlands adjacent to it, altering the shoreline. Matteo (under NJDEP oversight), NJDEP and EPA all have conducted investigations at the site. EPA sampling in 2005 and 2006 revealed crushed battery casings and lead contamination adjacent to and in the trailer park. Under a May 2006 Administrative Consent Order issued by EPA, Matteo installed a chain-link fence to restrict access to contaminated areas. To facilitate the fence installation, approximately 425 tons of contaminated soil were excavated for off-site disposal.   A Record of Decision was signed in October 2019 and the design of the remedy is underway.  A removal action has begun to remove contaminated soil at a commercial facility.<br/><br/>OU2 of the Matteo and Sons, Inc. Superfund site is a residential neighborhood in West Deptford, NJ. Prior to residential development the crushed battery casing waste was used as fill and during construction the waste was distributed throughout the neighborhood. Approximately 25 of the 36 residential properties comprising the neighborhood are impacted with battery casing waste and soil with elevated concentrations of lead, antimony, and PCBs. Battery casing waste and soil impacts are predominantly in the surface and shallow sub-surface soil. Exposure pathways to the battery casing waste and impacted soil in the residential yards are complete and uncontrolled.  A ROD was signed in 2017 and a remedial action for excavation of residential properties is ongoing.  <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets. A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site. Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.<br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of June 2021, the Arsenic Mine Superfund Site is considered \"Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because of continuing exposure to arsenic on residential properties. In April 2019, the Removal Program mobilized to perform interim actions to protect public health, including providing residents indoor and outdoor door mats and boot brushes, excavating soil in dog pens and backfilling with wood chips, creating woodchip or stone walkways, and paving or adding stone to driveways. In addition, quarterly drinking water assessments started in April 2019.  Because arsenic concentrations in the surface soil on ten residential properties greatly exceed state and federal residential soil screening values, ATSDR determined that current and potential future exposures to arsenic in residential soil on the site warranted the issuance of a Public Health Advisory. In its April 2019 Public Health Advisory, ATSDR recommended that EPA take short- and long-term measures as soon as feasible to dissociate residents from exposure to arsenic in soils on the site.  The site was listed on the NPL in October 2019.  A ROD for the dissociation of residents was issued on June 29, 2020. Pursuant to an IAG, the Baltimore District of USACE has conducted a reconnaissance of the properties that we intend to make offers to acquire and has also prepared  a Real Estate Planning Report.  Interviews with the interested residents will occur in  late June.  Fieldwork for OU2, which will focus on the nature and extent of contamination at the site, is expected to begin in late summer/fall of 2021.  EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets. An EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise."

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of June 2021, the Hudson River PCBs Superfund Site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control because of the potential for ingestion of fish caught from the river by those who do not follow the fish consumption advisories and fishing restriction. Remedial activities completed to date (dredging) have substantially reduced PCB source materials in the Upper Hudson River. As expected in the Record of Decision, average PCB concentrations in fish in the Upper Hudson are declining but have not yet reached protective levels. Because the remedy includes not only the dredging component but also the subsequent period of monitored natural attenuation, remedy is not complete until the natural attenuation component also has been completed. EPA believes it is likely that improvement will occur gradually over several decades at least. In the interim, the State of New York has in place fishing restrictions and advisories against consumption of fish to control human exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks. EPA acknowledges that the consumption advisories are not fully effective in that they rely on voluntary compliance in order to prevent or limit fish consumption. EPA will continue to work with New York State to ensure the ongoing maximum effectiveness of the advisories.<br/><br/>Dredging work was completed in 2015. EPA estimates that the dredging project removed about 72% of the mass of PCBs in the Upper Hudson River.  The dredging project resulted in the removal of about 2.75 million cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment. Approximately 310,000 pounds of PCBs (twice the mass anticipated) were permanently removed from the river.  <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets. Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise. A Community Advisory Group (CAG) comprised of members representing diverse interests along the river has been established to disseminate site information and solicit public comments on project activities.<br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of June 2021, there is insufficient information to determine the site-wide human exposure control status at the Wappinger Creek site.  The Wappinger Creek site in Wappinger Falls, New York, is the location of contaminated sediments for which the sources of contamination have not been definitively identified. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) collected surface water and sediment samples from this tidally influenced creek and from Wappinger Lake upstream.  The analytical results for the samples indicated that creek sediments are contaminated with several inorganic constituents and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) at concentrations above NYSDEC screening values.  The main contaminants of concern are mercury, lead, zinc, and chromium.   In May of 2021, EPA initiated field work for the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study to further define the nature and extent of contamination at the site. Once the study is complete, EPA can determine the best cleanup method for the site.  The potential exposure pathways are not yet identified.  It is not anticipated that the risk assessment will be completed before 2023, as a result a site-wide human exposure determination is not anticipated to be made before 2023.<br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.<br/><br/>"

Construction activities had been completed at the site, however, subsequently another exposure pathway (vapor intrusion) was identified off-site.  This pathway involves the inhalation of VOCs that have potentially migrated from the groundwater to indoor air.  A removal action has been taken to remediate the homes that have been impacted.  Several iterations of sampling have occurred over the heating seasons the last few years in an effort to identify additional homes that may have been impacted and to determine the extent of possible human exposure through this pathway.  In addition, EPA has drafted a workplan for additional investigation of the groundwater off the industrial property and is currently negotiating the implementation of this workplan with the PRP; this work is expected to be conducted in 2021 and 2022 and will determine the extent of the site-related plume, and the potential that another non-site related source could be contributing to groundwater contamination and VI concerns.   As a result, it is not envisioned that EPA will have sufficient information to determine the site-wide human exposure control status until at least 2022.<br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of June 2021, there is insufficient information available to determine the site-wide human exposure control status at the Dewey Loeffel Landfill site.  Prior to the site being added to the NPL, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation implemented a number of actions to mitigate potential exposures to humans in the vicinity of the landfill, including containment of the landfill, pumping and treatment of some impacted groundwater, and removal of PCB-contaminated soil and sediments from tributaries feeding Nassau Lake.  EPA has also implemented a removal action that resulted in the construction of a treatment plant that allows collection of groundwater and leachate year-round, and on-site treatment (rather than seasonal collection with off-site trucking and treatment).  A second removal action was initiated in 2018 to address significant sediment contamination in one of the drainageways feeding Nassau Lake; this removal action was approximately 50% complete in the fall of 2019, however unexpected significant lateral contamination into the sides of the steep banks of the drainageway resulted in the termination of the removal action with the remainder of the drainageway being addressed under the remedial process.  Nassau Lake is used recreationally and as a local fishery, however, there is currently a ban on fish consumption for Nassau Lake due to PCB levels found in nearly all species native to the lake.  As the site is being addressed by PRP removal actions and a phased remedial program, risk assessments for the entire site are not expected to be completed until 2023; at that time EPA will have sufficient information to determine the site-wide human exposure control status.  <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices, and updating fact sheets.  A Community Advisory Group (CAG) comprised of members representing interests in the community meets regularly and serves as a forum to disseminate Site information and solicit public comments on project activities.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.<br/>"

These include fish advisory already established by NJDEP. Also, NJDEP’s residential (unrestricted use) standard for PCBs of 0.2 mg/kg is not an ARAR for properties in the floodplains that constitute the majority of the land to be addressed by this remedial action, which are mostly municipal or county land (such as park land or designated open space), and not subject to future residential use; however, land use restrictions, in the form of a deed notice or similar control, may be needed on a few privately owned parcels, to assure remedy protectiveness. The deed notice or other legal instrument would assure that the land use does not become residential/unrestricted in the future. <br/><br/>The remedy requires continued signage to remind anglers and other recreational users of the Bound Brook corridor of the presence of PCBs in sediments and fish, and the need to take preventative measures, such as catch-and-release, when in the area.<br/><br/>EPA is currently designing the cleanup of contaminated sediment and flood plain soils. <br/>"

EPA is currently conducting a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (OU4) to identify the nature and extent of the groundwater contamination and the soils contamination at the facilities that contributed to the groundwater contamination.  The Record of Decision is expected in 2021. A responsible party is also conducting a groundwater contamination and soils investigation to determine its responsibility for area-wide groundwater contamination (OU3).  In addition, a study was conducted that determined that the landfill cap (OU2) that was constructed at the municipal landfill is sufficient and protective of human health and the environment.  In addition to the landfill cap, surface water control and landfill gas controls are in place. The landfill has been fenced.  The groundwater is contaminated with volatile organic compounds, including trichloroethylene (TCE), chloroform, benzene, tetrachloroethylene (PCE), and vinyl chloride.  Vapor intrusion investigations at the site have indicated volatile organic contaminates (TCE and PCE) are entering residential structures and installation of vapor intrusion mitigation systems is ongoing.   EPA has already overseen completion of some groundwater clean-up activities (OU1)at the site, including the construction of a groundwater treatment facility which is currently not operating since very low contaminant concentrations remained in this area of the contaminated groundwater plume.  Monitoring of groundwater in this area continues.  The results of the investigations will enable EPA to make a Human Exposure determination for the site and to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to control exposures, if necessary.  The remaining potential exposure pathways are not yet identified; therefore, there is insufficient data to determine the status of the site. <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Sampling has shown that soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment in the vicinity of the site have elevated concentrations of arsenic and lead. A number of actions are currently taking place to mitigate potential exposure to these contaminants. These actions include (1) the cleanup and restoration of impacted residential properties in the vicinity of the former Kil-Tone facility. As of June 2021, 32 residential properties have been fully addressed and at least another 48 residential properties still need to be addressed; (2) design of the cleanup of at least 40 impacted non-residential properties in the vicinity of the former facility; (3) continued development of the remedial investigation and feasibility study for groundwater in the vicinity of the site, and; (4) initiation of the remedial investigation and feasibility study for the surface water and sediment of the Tarkiln Branch, as well as for the floodplain of the branch.  The Tarkiln Branch is a tributary to Parvin Branch which feeds into the Maurice River and eventually Union Lake.  The Maurice River and Union Lake are used recreationally. NJDEP has issued fish consumption advisories for the Maurice River and Union Lake for issues unrelated to the Former Kil-Tone Company site.  EPA will continue to conduct further studies to determine if arsenic and lead are impacting these water bodies. <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices, and updating fact sheets.

Key public areas have been posted with safety/security/public health signage while EPA collects additional data and works with the State on fish consumption advisories. <br/><br/>EPA has already initiated cleanup activities at the site.  Currently, a remedy has been implemented for the uplands portion of the site.  Mercury-contaminated soils have been excavated from the uplands area and disposed of off-site.  Areas with soils containing mercury above residential levels have been capped and prepared for industrial redevelopment, and Institutional Controls (ICs) have been placed on eight properties.  Mercury-contaminated soils have also been removed from ditches that lead from the uplands to the wetlands of Berry’s Creek.  A vertical hydraulic barrier system was installed to capture contaminated groundwater and prevent migration into the Berry’s Creek watershed.  ICs in the form of a Classification Exception Area and Well Restriction Area are in place to prevent use of contaminated groundwater.  An interim remedy to address contaminated sediments within certain reaches of the Berry’s Creek portion of the Site, OU2, and contaminated soils at the Upper Peach Island Creek marsh was finalized in 2018, and the design of this interim remedy began in 2019.  This interim remedy will remove sediments and marsh soils contaminated with mercury, methylmercury, PCBs and chromium.  Methylmercury and PCBs have also been identified in fish and crab tissue.  Studies to address contamination in the marshes and in the downgradient reaches of Berry's Creek will be conducted once the interim remedy is completed.  <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  An EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.  <br/><br/>"

The approximately 170-acre landfill is bounded by private residential properties to the north and northwest. Wetlands occupy the adjacent areas to the east, south, and west of the site. The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, approximately 35 acres of which are part of the site, also borders the site to the south and east. A remedial investigation of soil, groundwater, sediment and surface water was completed in 2018.  A human health risk assessment was completed in 2014 and updated in 2018 and found that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil at the landfill pose an unacceptable risk to trespassers or passive recreators. Groundwater sampling to date indicates isolated areas of contamination consisting primarily of metals, PCBs and benzene, and that contamination in groundwater is limited to a depth of about 25 feet below the surface, located above a thick confining clay layer in the landfilled area and is not migrating off-site. This shallow groundwater cannot be used for potable wells and nearby residents have a public water supply. EPA is currently evaluating cleanup options and will prepare a plan to address the risks posed by site contamination.   <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise. A Community Advisory Group (CAG) comprised of members representing diverse interests in the community has been established to disseminate site information and solicit public comments on project activities."

Contaminants at the site include chromium, lead, dioxin, PCB aldrin and PCB Aroclors in soil and sediment.  At one time an \"oil lake\" was present over portions of the site, and remnants of this release are still evident in site samples. In 2009 EPA selected an early action remedy to address the remnants of the \"oil lake\".  A bench scale study indicated the selected remedy would not be effective.  In 2017, EPA amended the remedy to address the oil lake remnants and also issued a Record of Decision to address contaminated soil and sediment  at the remainder of the site. The remedy to address the remnants of the oil lake as well as soil and sediment is currently under remedial design. The groundwater for the site is to be addressed under a separate operable unit.

Abandoned tanks and drums and asbestos-containing material have been removed.   EPA is currently conducting a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study to determine the nature and extent of soil contamination at the site.  Once the study is complete, EPA can determine the best cleanup method for the soils.  The potential exposure pathways are not yet identified; therefore there is insufficient data to determine the status of the site.\r<br/>\r<br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.\r<br/>\r<br/>\r<br/> \r<br/>"

Currently, a groundwater extraction and treatment system is operating to manage the off-site migration of groundwater contaminated with arsenic; institutional controls are also in place to restrict potable use of the contaminated groundwater until the aquifer is restored.  In addition, treatment of plant site soils, considered the primary source of the arsenic contamination, is complete.  Contaminated sediments from the stream and wetland have been removed and that area has been restored back to the original Atlantic White Cedar wetlands.  The present focus of remedial activities is on preventing groundwater seeps from contaminating sediments in a limited section of the stream, and the site is being re-evaluated on a holistic basis to address this concern. EPA continues to perform periodic monitoring of water and sediment and review this data with State government representatives. Several years of sediment and surface water monitoring data at recreational areas downstream have shown no unacceptable risk.<br/><br/>"

EPA initiated a Remedial Investigation (RI), to include a risk assessment, which is anticipated to be complete in 2022. Of concern is an abandoned and contaminated former Mill complex. In FY2018, the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) completed an Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analysis (EE/CA) resulting in EPA's selection of a demolition alternative that was memorialized in an Action Memorandum. In April 2019, EPA issued notice letters inviting the PRPs to perform the Non-time Critical Removal Action (NTCRA). An AOC was reached with the PRPs to perform additional geophysical testing - needed to properly and safely demolish the mill; site security measures were also included and are in the process of being implemented. Despite the attempts by the PRPs to secure the Mill, trespassers are still able to access the abandoned building. A draft AOC to perform the NTCRA (demolition of the mill) is currently being negotiated and is anticipated to be signed by December 2022. It is anticipated that the demolition of the mill will take approximately 2 to 3 years.<br/><br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2021, the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because nearby residents and recreational users of the Woonasquatucket River are reasonably anticipated to be exposed to unacceptable levels of dioxin and other contaminants through contact with sediment in the river and floodplain.  Ingestion of fish from the Woonasquatucket River also poses an unacceptable risk.  The river and riverbank are active recreational areas.  This Human Exposure Control determination is based primarily on risk assessment(s) prepared for the site that took concentration of chemicals present and the frequency/duration of exposure to these chemicals, among other things, into account.  EPA has removed contaminated soil located in the backyards of residences immediately adjacent to the river and installed fences restricting access to contaminated sediment in these areas.  EPA has also capped three source areas of contamination, reconstructed the Allendale Dam, and excavated source material that was contributing to groundwater contamination in order to prevent further migration of contamination.    <br/>EPA evaluated numerous remedial alternatives to address river and floodplain sediments containing unacceptable levels of dioxin contamination. EPA released a Proposed Plan outlining the proposed cleanup approach in October 2011, and a Proposed Plan Amendment in July 2012.   In conjunction with the release of the Proposed Plans, numerous public informational meetings and public hearings were held. A Record of Decision (ROD) was signed in September 2012. The primary component of the remedy outlined in the ROD calls for excavation of a large volume of contaminated material.  <br/>A Rhode Island Department of Public Health fishing advisory has been in place since the mid-1990s.  EPA continues to work with the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council to develop annual fact sheets that remind residents about using the river responsibly.  EPA also holds periodic dialogue forums with community groups, local citizens, elected officials, and state and federal agencies to discuss the cleanup for the site.<br/>"

This insufficiency is due to the limited number of site investigations that have occurred over the last several years to determine the nature and extent of the soil, sludge, sediment and groundwater contamination resulting from past tannery operations.    <br/><br/>The city has requested that additional funding mechanisms for cleanup be pursued (including through redevelopment of the site).  In 2007, EPA's removal program responded to a fire at the site based on a request from local fire officials.  Public updates and a press event were held during this response effort.  In 2012, the City of Nashua funded and completed the demolition of the former tannery buildings. In addition, EPA and NHDES conducted several field investigation activities in the summer/fall of 2012 within the southernmost 15-acre parcel of the overall 30-acre Site.  The purpose of the activities was to evaluate whether all or a portion of this undeveloped, 15-acre southern parcel can be redeveloped without the need for remediation. <br/><br/>An evaluation of acceptable remedial alternatives is currently being conducted. Once available information and the review of remedial alternatives is completed, the site-wide Human Exposure determination for the site will be updated. <br/><br/>"

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "The Callahan Mining Corporation Superfund site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because PCBs are present in surface soil above levels considered acceptable for contact by a recreational or trespass visitor to the site.  The September 30, 2009 Record of Decision (ROD) identified the PCBs as a principal threat waste.  The ROD also identified the PCBs, lead, and arsenic as contaminants of concern that will be the focus of a portion of the cleanup action. \r<br/>\r<br/>This Human Exposure Control determination is based primarily on human health risk assessment(s) prepared for the site that took concentration of chemicals present and the frequency/duration of exposure to these chemicals, among other things, into account.  The primary contaminants of concern at the residential properties are arsenic and lead.  The primary concern for the non-residential portion of the site is PCBs.  \r<br/>\r<br/>The 2009 ROD outlines the remedy for the site.  Among other things, the ROD calls for the excavation and off-site disposal of soil above the site-specific cleanup values. The 2009 ROD also includes actions to protect ecological receptors from exposure to contaminated sediment and seeps and containment of the waste rock and tailing.\r<br/>\r<br/>Cleanup work to address unacceptable current human exposure was initiated in 2011.  During the remedial work, the extent and quatity of PCB contamination was found to be more signficant than anticipated.  While the on-site PCB cleanup will not be complete until 2013, arsenic and lead contamination has been removed from the residential properties.  Cleanup of the five residential properties is complete.  \r<br/>\r<br/>"

This Human Exposure Control determination is based on site-specific risk assessments that took concentration of chemicals present and the frequency/duration of exposure to these chemicals, among other things, into account. <br/><br/>EPA's full scale dredging program began in 2004 and accelerated in 2014 after a cash-out settlement with the main responsible party. Subtidal dredging is now complete and work is underway on several areas of intertidal shoreline contamination.<br/><br/>EPA operates an outreach campaign to dissuade the consumption of local PCB-contaminated seafood. This effort includes the education and medical communities, as well as meetings with stakeholders and local officials. Signs are posted in multiple languages around the harbor shoreline describing the existing fishing ban.  Additionally, EPA produced and posted a video on its New Bedford Harbor project website about the hazards of consuming contaminated fish from various areas of the harbor. Nonetheless, EPA continues to receive reports that consumption of seafood from posted areas is ongoing among some residents. "

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2021, the Raymark Industries, Inc. Superfund site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because individuals could come into contact with soil contaminated with lead, asbestos, and PCBs above acceptable levels at approximately 20 locations (note: as a result of the ongoing remedial action the number of properties previously contaminated with Raymark Waste was 26) throughout the town of Stratford, Connecticut. This Human Exposure Control determination is based primarily on risk assessment(s) prepared for the site. Direct contact with and inhalation of the dust associated with manufacturing waste exceeds acceptable levels.<br/><br/>EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in July 2011 outlining final source control remedies at four locations and interim actions to reduce or restrict exposures through the use of institutional controls at the other locations. In September 2016, EPA issued another ROD outlining permanent remedies for 22 additional properties as well as Ferry Creek. Waste in soil, wetland soil, and sediment is being excavated and transported to OU4 (a former ballfield at the Raymark facility where some waste has already been placed), where it will be consolidated and capped. Remedial Designs for OU6 properties were completed in 2019. The implementation of the consolidation remedy is expected to last 4 years from the start of construction in 2019. For OU2 (the contaminated groundwater area), the remedy includes installation of vapor mitigation systems (VMS) at approximately 20 additional properties (mostly residential); this work was completed in FY2020 bringing the total number of properties with a VMS to 122.<br/><br/>EPA has expended approximately $200 million in prior work at the Site, including completing environmental assessment at over 500 individual properties throughout Stratford; these assessments resulted in the removal of Raymark Waste from 47 residential properties in the 1990s. In the late 1990s, the former faciality was demolished, a cap was constructed, and the property was redeveloped (i.e., Stratford Crossing shopping plaza). Investigations are ongoing at four additional OUs, for which EPA expects to issue cleanup proposals in the next two to three years.<br/>"
