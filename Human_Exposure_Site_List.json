      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2023, the Bremerton Gas Works Superfund site is considered “Current Human Exposure Not Under Control” (HENC). The exposure pathways for workers in the upland include subchronic and/or chronic exposure to soil contaminated with arsenic, carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (cPAHs), and naphthalene. The Tribal exposure pathway is from chronic exposure to surface sediment, surface water while collecting shellfish, and consumption of shellfish from sediment contaminated with cPAHs. This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria. Construction worker subchronic exposure to soil: RME soil noncancer HIs: adult (70), Occupational worker chronic exposure to soil: RME soil cancer risks: adult (4 x 10-4),  RME soil noncancer HI: adult (3) and Tribal chronic exposure to sediment, surface water, and clam consumption cancer risks: RME adult (2 x 10-4), child (1 x 10-4), and adult/child (3 x 10-4).<br/><br/>Cascade Natural Gas (CNG, a potentially responsible party) completed time critical removal actions (TCRAs) in 2010 and 2013 to address immediate exposure risks when sheen appeared in the Port Washington Narrows. During the 2010 TCRA, CNG cut and plugged a pipe that was believed to be the source of the sheen and placed an organoclay mat over impacted sediment. During the 2013 TCRA, CNG removed solid hydrocarbon material in the west beach area and installed an organoclay mat, plugged the manhole that was connected to the pipe, and installed signage to warn beach users of the presence of hydrocarbon sediments on the beach.<br/><br/>The planned activities to address exposure pathways are to complete the remedial investigation and feasibility study to determine the remedial action required to reduce risk at the site. EPA anticipates that human exposure will be under control by January 1, 2031, because the remedial action will be complete and institutional controls implemented. Current exposure to workers to exposed soil in the uplands is considered minimal as most of the site is vacant, paved, or used as storage facilities. Beach access is limited due to the steep bluff and because the adjacent property is surrounded by a locked fence. Signs are posted to warn individuals that the beach is closed and not to harvest shellfish. The Washington Department of Health has also issued a fish advisory for the Port Washington Narrows prohibiting shellfish harvesting due to water pollution from combined sewer overflows (CSOs).  <br/>",

Soil, sediment and surface water are impacted by chlorinated solvents. Potential exposure pathways exist at both Operable Unit 1 (OU1) and Operable Unit 2 (OU2). At OU1, a 2011 risk assessment identified dermal and inhalation risk to long-term industrial/commercial and utility workers from contaminated soil and groundwater. EPA began an interim remedial action to treat contaminated soil and groundwater at OU1 in spring 2000 that will continue through 2024. At OU2, there are potential risks to downgradient residents who rely on water sourced from private drinking wells. A number of properties within OU2 were connected to the Chehalis public-water supply system via an EPA removal action in the early 2000s, but many households still obtain their drinking and household use water from private wells. To date, no site contamination has been found in these private wells; however, if PCE in groundwater continues to migrate there is concern that the contaminated plume will reach these properties in the future. <br/><br/>EPA uses “Insufficient Data to make a Human Exposure Evaluation” status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring above acceptable risk-based levels. As of September 2023, the planned activities to collect sufficient information to evaluate this new exposure pathway and/or contaminants include completing a site-wide remedial investigation. The remedial investigation consists of using geoprobes and additional monitoring wells to define the boundaries of the contaminated groundwater plume and characterize nature and extent of chlorinated solvents in soil and sediment source areas. Sediment along Berwick Creek will also be sampled to define potential risks downgradient from OU1. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure evaluation by 2025.<br/>EPA is currently monitoring groundwater among downgradient residents who may be at risk. EPA installed two groundwater monitoring wells upgradient of the at-risk residents and has offered semi-annual well sampling to residents until the edges of the plume are fully delineated. To date, no PCE has been detected in the sentinel wells or private wells. EPA completed a Community Involvement Plan at the site in 2021 and is in active communication with potentially affected residents and businesses. At OU1, post treatment monitoring began in 2022. Signage detailing site information for the interim action at OU1 is present on the west side of Berwick Creek and there is a fence along the east side of Berwick Creek adjacent to Interstate 5. The City of Chehalis has a “call before you dig” ordinance which would be used to educate and limit exposures in trenches. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure evaluation by 2025.

The Portland Harbor Potentially Responsible Parties, under EPA and DEQ oversight, have collected and analyzed sediment, surface water, groundwater, and fish tissue data at the site. Contaminants of concern include heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs, PAHs, and dioxins/furans. The known exposure pathways for people are fish and shellfish consumption, ingestion of surface water, and direct contact with sediments. All of these pathways result in unacceptable exposures to humans. EPA has determined that the greatest health risk from exposure to contamination in Portland Harbor is from eating resident fish and to infants that are breast-fed by mothers who eat resident fish on a regular basis. The State Health Department has issued a health advisory and posted signs advising people to limit consumption of fish from the site. However, people are likely still eating the fish and fishing is observed daily at the site. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is working with upland facilities to investigate and control ongoing sources of contamination to the site. EPA issued a Record of Decision in 2017 and an Explanation of Significant Differences in 2019. The site is currently in Remedial Design. EPA posts major documents on its website and sends information regarding meetings and availability of major documents to a listserv (over 1,000 people) and has monthly meetings with the Citizen Advisory Group (which are open to the public).

Land use controls (LUCs) prohibit soil disturbance without a dig permit approved by Air Force environmental staff. LUCS prohibit the use of groundwater as a drinking water source but do not prevent exposure that may occur due to vapor intrusion from groundwater contaminated with volatile substances. Surface water is the primary drinking water source for Fort Richardson. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure evaluation by 2030 due to the number of sites and types of contaminants under investigation.",

A previous Record of Decision for OU B Marine addressed PCB contamination in fish tissue and sediments, but only reduced mercury concentrations in sediment where mercury was collocated with PCB contamination that required remedial action.<br/><br/>EPA and DOD currently anticipate that human exposure will be under control by 2030 once the remedial action is complete.  <br/><br/>In addition, the Washington Department of Health has a fish consumption advisory in place for Sinclair Inlet, and the Navy has an exclusion zone restricting access in the nearshore areas of their facility.<br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2020, there is insufficient data to determine the human exposure status of the Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station Superfund site. In the 2008, Sediment Tissue Long Term Monitoring report for OU2 Area 8, levels of cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury in littleneck clams harvested from seep areas exceeded levels deemed protective of human health. Currently, there are fish advisories in place to deter shellfish harvesting in this area.  The Navy controls access and the Suquamish Tribe has warned its members not to harvest or eat clams in this area. EPA has been told by Tribal representatives that tribal members generally adhere to the harvesting guidelines provided by the Tribe. Therefore, EPA and the state believe that there are adequate controls in place such that there is no likely exposure pathway for human health risk from consumption of littleneck clams near Area 8. However, the 2008 study identified potential sediment contamination from Area 8 seeps that may be a source of potential contamination in the deeper sub-tidal areas. This contamination may impact other fish in Liberty Bay that are not covered by the health department's fish advisories. The Navy’s most recent Five Year Review identifies this issue.  The Navy has collected additional data in accordance with a Sampling and Analysis Plan, and is performing both ecological and human health risk evaluations based on this data.  EPA estimates it will have sufficient information to determine the Human Exposure control status for this Site by 2021. ",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2021, the Commencement Bay, Near Shore/Tide Flats CERCLA site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control. Exposure to arsenic, lead, and benzene via soil, sediment and groundwater at concentrations greater than the cleanup goals established in the RODs are still occurring. Remediation of contaminated sediment in OU 01, which covers approximately 12 square miles, is not yet complete, and isolated areas of PCB contamination in the Hylebos Waterway sediments remain in the biologically active zone and surface water that bioaccumulate in fish tissue. Evaluation of PCBs will be conducted in 2022. Dioxins are also being evaluated in the Hylebos waterway - fish tissue samples were collected in 2019 and sediment samples were collected in 2021. Remediation of contaminated soil/slag in OU 02 (Former Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility) is occuring as areas of the site are redeveloped and is scheduled to be completed in June 2022. In the interim, human exposure to arsenic and lead in soil/slag is still possible. Institutional controls (temporary caps are in place at areas not yet remediated, fencing, air monitors) are in place to restrict access and reduce the potential for exposure by the community. Metro Parks Tacoma completed remediation of the Breakwater Peninsula in 2019 and redeveloped the area as a community park. During work being completed in 2017, it was determined that the shoreline cap installed by Asarco in 2001 has washed away and will need to be repaired. The shoreline cap repair will happen in 2022/2023. Institutional controls (signs) have been installed warning signs to prevent the public from entering this area until repairs are complete. In residential areas of Ruston and Tacoma (OU 04), exposure to lead and arsenic at concentrations posing unacceptable risk is still occuring via soil and household dust. EPA has remediated 1,990 properties and 452 rights-of-way, there are 4 properties undergoing active remediation, 3 properties needing RD/RA, 6 properties that refused remediation, and 23 properties that are located on steep slopes or in wetlands. Need institutional control (deed notices) to protect the remedy and limit future exposure to contaminated soil left in place. Other institutional controls (community protection measures) are being implemented by the State. Source control efforts have largely controlled contaminant migration from upland areas to Commencement Bay sediment (OU 05). However, localized areas of contaminated shoreline soil, groundwater, and uncontrolled sources continue to discharge to sediment and surface water. Groundwater is not a drinking water source and there is no human exposure route. Exposure to contaminated groundwater and sediment at the former Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility (OU 06) have not been fully controlled. While all historical infrastructure has been removed (OU 07), much of the site has been capped (see OU 02), and sources of contaminated soil have been removed and placed in an On-site Containment Facility (OCF). Groundwater monitoring wells are installed at the former Asarco Smelter site and GW monitoring will be conducted, and institutional controls prevent use of groundwater at the site. These wells will be installed later this year to commence monitoring the groundwater at the site. The sediments off-shore of the former Asarco Tacoma Smelter Facility have been capped, but the sediments in the moderately impacted area and Yacht Basin have yet to be remediated. Contaminated sediments in the moderately impacted area and Yacht Basin pose little risk to humans as the potential for exposure is low.",

Mobile DNAPL has been transported by groundwater to off-shore sediments.  Dissolved constituents of DNAPL are still being transported by groundwater and upwelling through lake sediments.  The risk assessment indicates that use of groundwater for drinking water, dermal contact with surface and subsurface soils, vapor intrusion into occupied buildings, and consumption of even modest quantities of shellfish would all pose unreasonable risks to humans.  Benthic organisms, benthic macroinvertebrates, and terrestrial and aquatic-dependent wildlife are all subject to unacceptable ecological risks.  No one is currently using contaminated water as a drinking water supply, installation of wells is currently prohibited, and the site is vacant, fenced and posted, thus limiting human exposure to contaminated soils.  However, children may be exposed to contaminants when wading and, most importantly, EPA is concerned about shellfish consumption by the local community. Although there are no fishing advisories specific to the site, the state health department has issued one for Lake Washington to limit PCB consumption.",

Ongoing creosote seeps on the beaches adjacent to a former wood treating facility provide a complete and direct exposure pathway to recreational and tribal beach users. Dermal contact and incidental ingestion of contaminated beach sediments results in a cancer risk above EPA’s risk range. Contaminant levels in shellfish tissue pose an unacceptable risk to both recreational and tribal shellfish harvesters. Signs are in place on the beach and in nearby parking lots and information kiosks to warn people of the risk. Information about the beach contamination is available on EPA’s web site. The beaches are closed to shellfish harvesting. The Washington Department of Health provides information about the closure on its web site. EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) amendment for the site in May 2018. EPA will use signage, fact sheets and social media to advise people of the contamination on the beaches until cleanup goals are achieved.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of January 2023, the Monsanto Chemical Co. (Soda Springs Plant) Superfund site is considered “Insufficient Data to make a Human Exposure evaluation” (HEID). Groundwater and surface water are impacted by cadmium, fluoride, nitrate, selenium, and manganese. Potential exposure pathways exist at the Site for current and future industrial workers, current and future residents, and current and future recreation. The site was previously categorized as Human Exposure Under Control (HEUC). Site activities and waste disposal practices contaminated groundwater, surface water, sediments, offsite soils, byproduct/source piles, and air. EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in 1997. The ROD selected remedial actions for the media listed above and established remediation goals for the following contaminants of concern (COCs) at the Site: cadmium, fluoride, nitrate as NO3/Nitrate as N, selenium, manganese, and radium-226. The selected remedy included monitored natural attenuation (MNA) with institutional controls (ICs) for groundwater, ICs for offsite soil in the form of land use restrictions placed in deeds, and no further action for surface water, source piles, air, and sediments. The third and fourth Five-Year Reviews determined the nature and extent of groundwater plumes of site-related COCs are not well defined. Concentrations of COCs in groundwater and surface water remain above RGs and have exceeded RGs beyond the P4 property boundary. There are potential risks to downgradient residents who rely on water sourced from private drinking wells. No restrictions are in place to prevent installation and/or use of domestic or irrigation wells downgradient of the Site. <br/>EPA uses this Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring and that those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. The planned activities to collect sufficient information to evaluate the exposure pathways and contaminants are in progress. EPA, IDEQ, and P4 entered into an ASAOC in April 2021 for performance of a Supplemental Remedial Investigation (SRI) and Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) after the 2013 and 2018 Five-Year Reviews found the selected remedy to not be protective. Current activities include evaluating the effectiveness of the three pump-back wells located at the southern end of the Plant site to capture groundwater containing elevated COCs and the effects of pumping on groundwater and surface water quality concentration trends downgradient of the Plant. Near-continuous pumping from pump-back wells have intercepted a significant portion of groundwater at the southern fence-line and the extent of the plume has been significantly reduced. Impacted groundwater no longer migrates off-site. Additional SRI activities include evaluating whether any new wells have been drilled in the area between the Site and the Bear River, and if new wells have been drilled, characterize groundwater quality in the wells. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure evaluation by December 2024 because the HHRA and SRI will be complete. <br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of July 2021, the Bunker Hill Superfund site’s measure of risks to people’s health is “Human Exposure Not Under Control.”  This is because some people living and working in and using the site for recreational purposes are exposed to elevated levels of lead and arsenic in soil, sediment, surface and drinking water.   Areas that could impact people’s health receive the highest priority for cleanup such as residential and commercial properties, school yards, parks, and mining sites that are close to homes or used for recreational purposes like riding All-Terrain-Vehicles (ATVs). <br/><br/>In the Bunker Hill “Box” communities (aka Operable Unit 1), about 3,200 properties have been cleaned up and 17 contaminated residential drinking water wells have been closed. Cleanup of the last eight Box residential properties will be completed when property owners grant access.  In the Bunker Hill “Coeur d’Alene Basin” communities (aka Operable Unit 3), about 3,900 properties have been cleaned up and seven homes provided under-sink water filtration systems.  Forty-eight additional properties have been sampled and require cleanup, but the owners have either refused or have not responded to multiple requests for access.  And approximately another 200 properties in the Basin remain to be sampled, but the owners of these properties have also refused access or are unresponsive.  A list of these types of properties is kept in case current owners change their minds or there is a change in ownership at which time requests for access begin again. <br/><br/>Reducing people’s exposure to elevated levels of lead and arsenic in soil, sediment, surface  and drinking water across the site is a multi-pronged approach.  In residential and commercial areas, it includes educational outreach, annual blood screening events, in-home assessments of sources of lead, and partial removal and replacement of contaminated soil.  Exposure to contaminated drinking water is reduced through public information efforts, supplying alternative sources of drinking water, installation of water filtration systems, and closing of drinking water wells.  Reducing exposure to contaminated soil at recreational areas and mine sites consists of a combination of access controls, signage, capping and removals.  <br/><br/>The site's vast size and high levels of contamination mean that cleanup will take several more decades, but many of the worse areas that affect people who live and work within the site have been addressed. Mine and mill site cleanups, as well as recreational sites, continue to be prioritized based on potential for lead exposure.  And overlaying these efforts is an Institutional Controls Program of locally developed and enforced rules and regulations to protect completed cleanups and limit exposures to contaminated soil currently left in place.<br/>",

Off-site residents exposed to groundwater is considered a hypothetical scenario. However, there are no institutional controls in place to prevent future well drilling.<br/>Currently, the planned activities to address this pathway are to implement a Record of Decision Amendment in 2023 to establish institutional controls that will be employed in conjunction with active groundwater treatment to reduce contaminant concentrations in groundwater and return the aquifer to beneficial reuse within a reasonable timeframe. If you are impacted by risk inherent at this site, contact the Remedial Project Manager for information. Based on information obtained from the 2019 SRI Report, BHHRA and SLERA, there is no current human health or environmental exposure to contamination on or off-site. The Multistate Trust has conducted a domestic well survey and no private wells have been identified within the area of groundwater contamination and has confirmed through communications with the city that clean water provided by the city to its residents, and to select locations outside of city limits, is available to all properties that are located geographically within the area of site-related groundwater contamination.<br/>EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by September 2025. On-site institutional controls are planned and will be implemented after the ROD Amendment is issued. The Multistate Trust owns the property and any land use change must be approved by EPA and IDEQ.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of March 2023, the Iron King Mine Humboldt Smelter is currently designated as \"Human Exposure Not Under Control\".  EPA has completed the remedial investigation and feasibility study.  EPA has performed removal actions in 2006, 2011, and 2017 that have eliminated human exposures to contaminated residential soils. However, actions to address the mine tailings in tailings piles, drainages, flood plains, behind the dam, and on the former smelter property, are ongoing, pending completion of the feasibility study pending the selection and performance of the site remedy.  The public comment period on EPA’s proposed plan for the site runs from March 15 – May 13, 2023.   These are not areas of usual human contact.  However, while certain institutional controls are in place and human exposure is not certain, there could be casual/short-term human contact with these tailings and occasional inhalation hazards in the immediate vicinity of tailings areas during high winds.  There are tailings areas that cannot be effectively sealed off from all human access in all situations.  Such conditions will likely persist until such time as mine tailings and wastes are removed and capped in the remedial action to be selected by the ROD.  The primary chemicals of concern at the site are arsenic and lead. Sampling results indicate the presence of elevated levels of arsenic and lead that could present health risks if a person is exposed to these metals over an extended period of time.  In the last year EPA has posted numerous danger signs near contaminated areas.  EPA and the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality have taken actions to place an effective seal on waste dross material at the smelter to prevent aerial entrainment of dust, and to install a fence with warning signs, cutting off an access path children may have used to access the smelter plateau and dross.  We have also  reinforced gates to prevent casual access.  At the separate massive mine tailings pile at the former mine, thousands of feet of new fencing has been installed in an attempt to limit or eliminate human access to the pile.

Windblown dust inhalation exposures from mine waste are also possible.  The most highly contaminated soil/sediment area is fenced and warning signs are posted.<br/>This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because Arsenic concentrations are above the 100 mg/kg residential cleanup level. This level is for the 1x10-4 cancer risk level as outlined in various Health risk assessment documents including the 2020 Tailings area EECA.  <br/><br/>Currently, the planned activities to address this pathway are completion of a Non-time Critical Removal Action for the Main Tailings area by Argonaut Lane in November 2023 and continued investigation for the remaining areas to complete the Remedial Investigation.  Since contamination investigations are ongoing, no final decision on cleanup activities (ROD) has been made.  If you are impacted by risks inherent at this site, individuals can reduce exposure risk by staying out of fenced areas with mine contamination.   EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by 2029 because all investigations will be completed and remediation is likely to be proposed or underway.<br/><br/>In addition, EPA is currently completing a Non-Time Critical Removal Action of the main tailings area between Argonaut Lane and Hoffman Avenue and has started residential yard sampling to complete and additional cleanup in residential yards if sampling indicates it is necessary.  Residents will be informed of any exposure risks that may be found as part of residential soil sampling.<br/><br/>EPA has held community information briefings in conjunction with the Jackson City Council and will continue to do so in the future.  <br/><br/><br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2023, the Lava Cap Mine Superfund site is considered ''Current Human Exposure Not Under Control'' because recreational users of the area below the mine, known as the Lost Lake Dam area or Operable Unit 3, can be exposed to mine tailings, leading to incidental ingestion of arsenic in soil and airborne particulates and skin contact with contaminated sediments that are deposited along shoreline and upland areas.  In addition, residents may be exposed to arsenic and potentially other heavy metals via ingestion of contaminated fish from Lost Lake, or consumption of berries that grow wild along the shoreline, or surface water contact at the lake. These exposure pathways are considered unacceptable because although conservative assumptions were used, the human health risk assessment work indicates that cancer risks exceed EPA's acceptable risk-based criteria of 1x10-4 and risks are closer to 1x10-3. EPA's acceptable hazardous index of 1 is exceeded by three orders of magnitude for arsenic with a predicted maximum Hazard Index of 1,909 for a child resident.<br/><br/>Currently, EPA has carried out the following activities to address these pathways: EPA has informed all the residents in the area of concern (this is not a public area and is on private lands) that there can be exposure to arsenic from the tailings if they walk or use vehicles (bikes, motorcycles, ATVs, etc.) in the area, or eat fish from the lake or berries from the shoreline, but there is still evidence that people use the area for recreational purposes. The impacted area is a series of private properties that is too large to be fenced.  We have not put signs up since the parcels are privately owned. To reduce your potential risk at this site, residents should avoid the consumption of fish from the lake and berries that grow along the shoreline. Residents should also wash hands and shoes after walking through the area and avoid directly contacting sediments within the lake. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by 9/30/2030 because the remedy is expected to be implemented by then.<br/><br/>",

First, individuals are known to catch, consume, and sell (for consumption) fish from the area. Second, individuals may be exposed to mercury-contaminated surface or subsurface soil. This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish as well as exposure to mercury in soil can cause harm to children under 6 years of age that recreate at the site and may cause harm to adults that consume fish, including permanent damage to the nervous system and serious disabilities.<br/><br/>Currently, the planned activities to address this pathway include, at heavily used access locations to these water bodies, EPA, NDEP and NV Parks have posted health advisory signs to warn the public that fish should not be consumed. EPA released a fish advisory risk communication strategy with TASC assistance, including close coordination with the State. The EPA and NDEP are working with local jurisdictions, residents, and commercial parties to implement the Long-Term Sampling and Response Plan to address these concerns. If you are impacted by risks inherent at this site, please contact the Community Involvement Coordinator (Laura Hall at Hall.Laura@epa.gov or 415-308-3747). EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by 1/1/2040 because the site is large and complex.<br/><br/>In addition, EPA is currently finalizing an interim Record of Decision to include land use controls, compliance and monitoring to help prevent mercury exposure and keep contamination from spreading in the floodplain areas. <br/>",

The site was previously categorized as Human Exposure Under Control (HEUC).

In 2016, PFAS were detected in on-site drinking water as part of the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule 3 (UCMR3). The Army initiated a Site Inspection and confirmed the presence of PFAS in site soils and groundwater at the Depot above EPA’s Lifetime Health Advisories and RSLs at the time. In July 2022, the Army sampled private drinking water wells for PFAS and results were above the current RSLs. More information needs to be obtained regarding the actual use of these wells.<br/><br/>EPA uses this Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring and that those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. The planned activities to collect sufficient information to evaluate this new exposure pathway and/or contaminants(s) are to initiate a remedial investigation including a Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA). This will include collecting additional information about the human interactions with contaminated media and evaluating human health risk. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure evaluation by March 31, 2025, because the Remedial Investigation may take a couple of years to be completed. Out of an abundance of caution, if you live near this site, please contact the Army for additional information. This does not necessarily mean that unacceptable exposures are occurring, however. The Army continues to work with potentially impacted property owners to gain access for sampling and have informed well owners of the PFAS results where access was allowed.<br/>",

However, trespassing incidents continue to occur. In 2008, the Army and EPA selected a final remedy to, among other things, remove MEC from the surface. Significant progress in implementing the remedy has been made but as of 2022, the Army estimates that it will take at least another 8-10 years at the current pace, due to California’s wildfire danger and endangered species challenges associated with conducting vegetation clearance activities (in support of MEC removal).",

A Remedial Investigation is needed to fully evaluate the extent of PFAS contamination and evaluate risk to receptors. The PFAS Remedial Investigation is not planned this fiscal year, and the Air Force is unable to provide an anticipated schedule for further investigation of PFAS at Former Norton AFB. <br/><br/>VI - The Fifth Five Year Review identified some newly constructed buildings near some areas with VI risk; however, the Air Force determined that the closest building seems to be located outside the anticipated extent of vapor migration from the source area.  It is unclear whether additional sampling is needed to delineate the VI risk and update the Conceptual Site Model. In a letter dated April 22, 2021, the Air Force agreed to \"... pursue the addition of Land Use Controls (LUCs) prohibiting residential uses to protect against potential vapor intrusion via a formal Explanation of Significant Differences (ESD) for IRP Site 17 and AOC 33.\"",

This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because the remedy has failed and current levels of contamination exceed cleanup goals.  <br/><br/>Currently, the planned activities to address this pathway are The area is restricted by fencing and multilingual warning signs are posted on the upland fence and along the marine channel, visible to individuals fishing in boats; however, there have been reports of individuals fishing in the area. These measures do not prevent contaminated fish from migrating outside of the site where they might be harvested and consumed by individuals. EPA is continuing preparation of a focused feasibility study to evaluate alternatives for addressing the remaining contamination. In order to reduce risks inherent at this site, please follow the fish advisories posted in the general vicinity and for more information please contact the EPA Community Involvement Coordinator posted on our website. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by 9/30/2030 because a Record of Decision Amendment is warranted in order to select a new remedial action. <br/><br/>In addition EPA presented to the National Remedy Review Board and is currently working on revising the focused feasibility study.

The GW plume risk to the Pollock LA Dept of Water and Power (LADWP) municipal water supply wells is believed to be incomplete based on LADWP long-term wellhead sampling and treatment of GW. The RI/FS will update the CSM and is expected to select long-term GW remedies for the Pollock wellfield. <br/><br/>As well, vapor intrusion risk is being investigated as a new potential human exposure risk. Currently, there is insufficient information to evaluate VI human exposure at this site; however, based on indoor air sampling conducted at 15 homes in Feb 2022, the VI / GW to indoor air sampling pathway is incomplete. A second round of indoor air sampling will be conducted in winter 2022/23 at additional residences, businesses, and two schools. ",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of October 2021, the Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control. Consumption of mercury-contaminated fish from the adjacent Clear Lake is a complete pathway that poses health risks. <br/><br/>Site-related mercury has contaminated lake sediments in Clear Lake. Bioaccumulation of this mercury has resulted in elevated fish tissue methylmercury levels. For this reason, in 1987, 2009, 2014 and 2019, the State of California has issued and reissued a fish consumption advisory at Clear Lake. This information is distributed online and in the fishery regulations booklet provided to fishing license holders. EPA is currently pursuing increased community involvement efforts around this issue, following reports that the community is not being provided clear and consistent information around this issue.  <br/><br/>Potential trespassers onto the mine property itself may come into contact with mine wastes and soils contaminated with mercury, arsenic, and antimony. This exposure has been limited by site controls including fencing and signage. EPA's human health risk assessment shows that a recreational/trespass scenario is an unacceptable risk due to the high levels of mercury and arsenic present in the mine waste.  The risk assessment is based on exposures to youth, ages 6-17, that are most likely to recreate at the mine property.  <br/><br/>Mine waste present in the residential areas south of the site and on the Elem Indian Colony adjacent to the site also pose a risk to human health. In 1997, 2007 and 2010 EPA completed the removal actions to excavate and cap areas of contaminated mine wastes and soils in these residential areas. <br/><br/>EPA is performing a feasibility study to select a cleanup plan to prevent the continued discharge of mercury and other contaminants to Clear Lake and to clean up the contaminated mine wastes at the mine property.  EPA is continuing its remedial investigation to characterize the nature and extent of contamination in Clear Lake sediments and the North Wetland. EPA is also conducting a site-wide human health risk assessment to quantify risks from the site. EPA ensures community members know about and participate in site issues by holding community meetings, distributing outreach materials, and coordinating with the Elem Pomo Tribe.",

The planned activities to collect sufficient information to make a human exposure evaluation are as follows: EPA is overseeing early response actions that address releases of mining-influenced water to a mountain stream system, but has not completed a risk assessment for the entire site to quantify any remaining exposure to humans. The Risk Assessment involves over nine miles of potentially contaminated riparian area downstream of the mine. The surface water is not used as drinking water. Quantification of human risk is also complicated by consideration of exposure patterns unique to the Washoe Tribe whose members use this watershed. The site's location at 7,000 feet in the Sierra Nevada allows only limited seasonal access. The data gathering for the formal risk assessment is underway with an Administrative Order issued on June 23, 2008. The Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) is expected to be completed over the next several years. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure determination by 9/30/2025 because by then the evaluation of the RI and risk assessments will be completed.",

Based on the results of the recently completed human health risk assessment, the primary contaminants of concern are arsenic and lead. Arsenic and lead are present in soil and contaminated mine waste at the site in concentrations known to cause a human health risk, especially to children. People might be exposed to contaminated material at the site during recreational activities such as fishing, gathering materials, picnicking, and camping. The primary way that people are exposed to contamination at the site is by accidentally swallowing contaminated soil. The results of the human health risk assessment were shared with the Hoopa Valley Tribal Council during the July 21st, 2022, meeting. Community members were invited to the meeting via posts on the tribal Facebook page and website, an announcement in the Two Rivers Tribune, announcements on the KIDE radio, and flyers mailed to all Hoopa PO boxes. <br/><br/>Currently, the plan to address this contamination is to excavate the contaminated material and either dispose of it offsite in an appropriate landfill or in an engineered onsite repository designed to store the waste. If you are impacted by risks inherent at this site, you can reduce your exposure by thoroughly washing your hands before you eat and by thoroughly rinsing basket making materials with water before putting them in your mouth. It is not recommended to let young children play at the site. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by summer 2024 after remedial action is taken. In the interim, the Hoopa Valley Tribal EPA is currently maintaining a gravel cobblestone cover over previously exposed mine waste and has placed root wads to discourage and limit access to the site. <br/>",

EPA's main concern is whether TCE from Site measured in indoor air pose an unacceptable risk of short-term and chronic health effects due to TCE inhalation exposure. EPA has been implementing the 2010 vapor intrusion remedy to address buildings where elevated TCE and PCE concentrations have been found in indoor air. All nonresidential buildings overlying the shallow TCE groundwater contamination have been sampled to determine the appropriate response action and  vapor intrusion control systems have been installed in all new buildings in the vapor intrusion study area. A Site-wide Shallow Zone Feasibility Study is currently underway to establish a framework and evaluate alternative groundwater cleanup technologies to address the source of vapor intrusion. The activities planned to make the Human Exposure Control determination include completion of the sewer pathway and building specific evaluations, where necessary, and implementing any necessary response actions.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of October 2022, the Montrose superfund site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control because the Palos Verdes Operable Unit has ocean sediment contaminated with significant levels of DDT and PCBs. These contaminants impact fish that reside in the area, especially the white croaker. Human exposure occurs through consumption of contaminated fish caught within the Palos Verdes Shelf area. The fish advisory from the State of California added barred sand bass and topsmelt to the \"do not consume\" list for PV Shelf. There are institutional controls (ICs) in place, which include white croaker bag limits, advisories and warnings for the area, educational outreach programs, and a commercial fishing ban on catching white croaker from the PV Shelf. However, periodic monitoring of the local fishing piers show that white croakers are being caught by independent fishermen for consumption. The selected remedy includes continuation of the Institutional Controls (ICs) program along with monitored natural recovery (MNR) and capping the most contaminated sediments. The comprehensive ICs program has been effective in reducing -- but not completely eliminating -- the consumption of white croaker and fishing of white croaker in the contaminated area.  In light of new MNR data which appears to indicate that the hotspot capping component of the interim remedy is no longer necessary and in consultation with the Palos Verdes Shelf Technical Exchange Group, EPA is currently collecting data to support the upcoming Feasibility Study with Updated Conceptual Site Model And Risk Assessment.  The new Feasibility Study will select the final remedy for Palos Verdes Shelf.  EPA will continue the current ICs program (education, outreach, monitoring, and enforcement) until a final remedy is selected for the site. <br/> ",

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively referred to as PFAS) have been identified in soil and groundwater located on the site at concentrations above human-health screening levels. The site was previously categorized as “Human Exposure Under Control” (HEUC) because known soil and groundwater impacts from other contaminants were controlled such that no exposure to human receptors was occurring. Though remedies in some areas may control human exposure to PFAS, such as the prohibition of residential land use across portions of the site, some PFAS impacts are located in previously unassessed areas. <br/><br/>EPA uses this Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring and that those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. The planned activities to collect sufficient information to evaluate this new exposure pathway and/or contaminants(s) are the collection of additional soil and groundwater samples to determine the full vertical and lateral extent of PFAS impacts and a comparison of these impacts to potential exposure points, such as groundwater production wells. The Department of the Navy, the lead agency conducting the investigation, currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure evaluation by September 30, 2023 because the planned additional investigation should determine the extent of PFAS contamination in relation to potential exposure points.<br/>",

EPA is the lead for both groundwater and vapor intrusion for OU3. The ongoing RIs will include remedial actions to address the vapor intrusion pathway, as warranted. Operable Unit 1: In April 2009, EPA informed ADEQ that EPA would take the lead for investigating the vapor intrusion pathway. The off-site/residential area VI investigation began in 2010 and was completed in 2018. It included several rounds of soil vapor sampling, followed by indoor air monitoring, and frequent community meetings/presentations/fact sheets. Sixteen sub-slab mitigation systems (mitigating 18 homes – one is a multi-unit dwelling) have been installed at residences throughout the area and are regularly monitored. A sub-slab mitigation system was installed at a commercial building owned by the Arizona Department of Transportation in Fall of 2017. An in-situ pilot study began in January 2018 to evaluate whether injection of liquid-granulated-activated-carbon will reduce vapor intrusion in neighborhoods where mitigation systems are installed. This project is completed in 2021. It is an effective short-term solution, but not viable as a long-term remedy. The Former Motorola Plant Campus (on-site) investigation began in 2015 and was completed in 2017. Again, multiple rounds of soil gas and indoor air sampling and were conducted at the buildings throughout the complex. EPA also provided community presentations, fact sheets and handouts. Vapor intrusion was not found to be occurring throughout the complex. Operable Unit 2: The VI investigation began in 2017 and is ongoing. Where soil gas data indicated a potential for VI, indoor air sampling conducted to-date indicates vapor intrusion is not occurring in the buildings sampled. Multiple indoor air and fifteen soil gas sampling events have been completed, including additional step-out sample areas that were needed to bound the soil vapor concentrations to concentrations lower than the SGHHSLs. Additional indoor air sampling is needed where access has been difficult to obtain because residents have been reluctant during covid-19. Operable Unit 3: EPA conducted limited VI sampling at locations in OU3 during the TAGA (mobile lab) sampling event in 2014. A small TCE soil gas plume exists in OU3. Confirmation soil gas sampling was conducted in 2020 to determine if potential vapor intrusion exists for nearby commercial buildings. The results indicated indoor air sampling was needed in two buildings, including a residential hotel. The 2021 and 2022 results indicate vapor intrusion is not occurring in OU3.  The completion of indoor air sampling in OU2 will enable EPA to make a Human Exposure determination for the site and to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to control exposures, if necessary. Covid-19 shelter-in-place has delayed indoor air sampling from 2019 to date.  ",

Since October 2019, the Asarco Hayden Plant union workers have been on strike and the smelter is not operating.  Prior to the strike, a human health risk assessment was being conducted as part of the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS). One potential pathway for human exposure is inhalation of airborne contaminants and fugitive emissions when the smelter is operating. An air monitoring network is in place at the site and air monitoring data continues to be collected while the strike is occurring. The Chemicals of potential Concern (COPCs) for the inhalation pathway include arsenic, lead, copper and sulfur dioxide. Recent air monitoring results show an improvement in air quality as the smelter facility is not operating. Asarco completed many of the major facility upgrades in December 2018 and EPA continues to review the air monitoring data. The most recent air monitoring data while the smelter was operating continued to show that levels of arsenic and lead contamination exceeded the trigger levels established in the Air CD. EPA, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) and the University of Arizona are working together to conduct community outreach including public meetings in Hayden and Winkelman. In light of mandatory travel and gathering restrictions due to COVID-19, the next public meeting will very likely be virtual.",

Site investigations are underway addressing chemicals of concern (principally organochlorine compounds as TEQ toxicity, with contributing arsenic) in soils, sediments, slurry-sludges, waters and air. Because of the nature of the industrial operations and site-management activities, human exposure to the contaminated surface-media is presently controlled in a manner that limits the exposure-frequency. If changed-conditions were to increase the exposure frequency and⁄or duration, cancer-risk thresholds could reasonably result in unacceptable human-health risk at several locations across the Site. This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because cancer-risk thresholds can exceed the de minimus regulatory level of 1x10-6 based on preliminary risk-assessment calculation.<br/>Evaluating the source, releases, and exposure scenarios at this Site involving releases of gaseous chlorine (and hydrochloric acid) to the ambient air surrounding the Site presented unprecedented challenges for risk assessment. Releases to the atmosphere associated with typical operating conditions have been evaluated for short-term episodic exposure and risk. However, longer term (days to weeks) exposure and risk-evaluation associated with the period when NO chlorine control by the CRB (chlorine reduction burner) is operating have not been evaluated. Problematic exposure-effects have occurred within the 5-mile remedial investigation study area. Until such time as that exposure-scenario is evaluated, unacceptable human exposure effects could occur. Risk-response options under both the Clean Air Act and⁄or CERCLA are under consideration. To date, the planned activities to address Site conditions are beginning under a RCRA-CERCLA Enforcement Settlement Consent Decree with US Magnesium entered in Federal District Court in June 2021. Site management activities between EPA programs and the State of Utah are being arranged. <br/>If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, please contact EPA’s Community Involvement Coordinator with your questions. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by December 31, 2030, because of response plans under development. With entry of the Settlement Consent Decree, the portions of the Site that will be under CERCLA management, will now be able to proceed with the more traditional implementation of the Superfund process outlined in the National Contingency Plan, including more robust engagement with the community (TAG) interest group.<br/>",

Separate Remedial Investigations⁄Feasibility Studies (RI⁄FS) for both Operable Unit 1 (Community Properties) and Operable Unit 2 (Former Smelter Area) began in 2014. A plan proposing an early interim action was issued for the residential properties' indoor dust and soil cleanups in Operable Unit 1 (OU1 - Community Properties) in July 2017 due to exposures to lead- and arsenic- contaminated soil and indoor dust. EPA signed the Interim Record of Decision (i-ROD) in September 2017 and residential soil and indoor dust sampling and cleanups are ongoing. Due to the presence of properties needing cleanups on the former study area boundary, the Site study area was expanded to add 108 residential properties in September 2021. To date, 737 out of 858 anticipated soil cleanups and 384 out of 635 expected indoor dust cleanups have been completed; resident relocation is not required during the cleanups. The soil exposure and indoor dust-inhalation⁄exposure pathways are considered unacceptable based on EPAs Site-specific i-ROD cleanup criteria not having been met for all the OU1 properties. Site-specific i-ROD cleanup criteria are Lead: 350 ppm soil, 275 ppm indoor dust; Arsenic: 61 ppm soil and indoor dust. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by 2032 for this OU because we anticipate having our cleanup complete and Institutional Controls in place.<br/>The Operable Unit 2 (OU2 - Former Smelter Area) RI⁄FS is ongoing. Caution and No Trespassing signs were placed around the former smelter area in 2015. Despite the signage, there are several unhoused people continually living on OU2 and an active railroad prohibits fully limiting access to OU2 slag areas. All OU2 media, pathways, and contaminants of concern have not been fully characterized; however, one year of quarterly air monitoring (March 2018 to March 2019) showed that smelter area contaminants are not being entrained into adjacent neighborhoods. In 2019, quarterly surface water sampling with collocated sediment and pore water samples were collected and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law/Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (BIL/IIJA) funding received in 2022 will allow OU2 RI Work Plan updates and RI⁄FS tasks, including groundwater investigation, to resume in late 2022 (2023⁄Q1). <br/>EPA Remedial Project Managers (RPMs) and Community Involvement Coordinators (CICs) conduct extensive and ongoing community outreach to inform residents and property owners of the Site contaminants, potential exposure risks and best management practices for reducing exposure to Site-related lead contaminated soils and indoor dust as well as other sources of lead potentially present in homes and the affected neighborhoods. Outreach includes participation by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (support agency) and the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment (PDPHE). EPA also provides a cooperative agreement to, and works closely with, the PDPHE, who conducts blood-lead screening, home lead risk assessments, consumer product screening, and an extensive outreach and education program in the Site study area and to Pueblo medical professionals.<br/>",

Concerns for the human exposure pathways include one partial residential soil remedial action yet to be taken, potential community access to nearby waste piles from former mining operations (approximately 35 of the original 70 piles have not yet been addressed), and the stockpile of contaminated residential soils that were relocated to the RV Ranch property as funding was not available to transport the material to the Luttrell Regional Repository. The soils in this stockpile contain up to 10,000 ppm lead. The remedial action levels defined in the 2002 Record of Decision are 100 parts per million for arsenic and 400 parts per million for lead. <br/>The 2008 Record of Decision Amendment indicates drinking water for the Rimini community will be sourced from Tenmile Creek to address the human ingestion pathway concerns. However, there are eight major contributing adit discharges and associated outfall sediment loads that require remediation before the creek may be used as a drinking water source. Currently, most residences in Rimini, and those nearest the Tenmile Creek in the Landmark Subdivision, are provided drinking water via the EPA Bottled Water Program administered through a cooperative agreement with Lewis & Clark County. Use of private drinking water wells is considered unacceptable because levels of arsenic and other mining-associated metals levels exceed the drinking water standards (MCLs) by orders of magnitude.<br/>Currently, EPA and MDEQ are taking measures under the Cooperative Agreement to address the mine waste sites in the Minnehaha Creek drainage and transport the temporary residential stockpile located on the RV Ranch, Remedial Action anticipated to occur in FY 2023/24.  All other planned remedial action projects are waiting for design and remedial action funding. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, please contact the Lewis & Clark County Health Department at (406) 457-8900 or (406) 447-8351 for information and assistance related to the EPA Bottled Water Program. EPA and MDEQ currently anticipate that human exposure will be under control by September 30, 2028, pending receiving funding to conduct the work.<br/>",

This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because concentrations of lead and arsenic are above levels considered to be safe for residential use in the B&B Subdivision, and above levels considered to be safe for recreational use in the Waterman Smelter area. The B&B Subdivision and Waterman Smelter area are part of Operable Unit 2 (OU2). A remedial action is currently underway to remove vegetation and soil in areas where soils are above levels determined to be safe. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, please avoid areas that have been identified as having soil concentrations that are unsafe consistent with Agency outreach. In addition, please ensure that you obey informational signs and do not recreate until the remedial action is complete. UDEQ and EPA currently anticipate that human exposure will be under control at OU2 by June 2023. <br/>The Jacobs Smelter site is a state-lead NPL site. Cleanups in Operable Unit (OU) 1 (Former Jacobs Smelter area) and OU3 (Stockton Rail Yard) have been completed and those OUs have been deleted from the NPL. Cleanup has also been completed at OU4 (Kennecott Parcel) and the region will be working with headquarters to delete this OU in the future. At OU2, the Rawhide Ranchettes, which is a residential area within the OU, have been remediated. At OU5 (BLM Parcel), some work has been completed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) under a removal action, however, additional work is needed on a second parcel in OU5 to determine whether it should be included in the NPL site and whether additional cleanup actions may be necessary. A Remedial Investigation⁄Feasibility Study (RI⁄FS) is currently being planned for OU6 (Former Chicago and Carson Buzzo Smelters area). EPA plans to conduct this additional investigative work at OU6 to assess the potential ecological and human health exposures.<br/>",

Residential soil investigations and cleanups at OU1 (Residential Soils) are complete, institutional controls are in place, and human exposure to lead and arsenic in soils at residential properties at OU1 is under control and no longer a concern. OU1 was deleted from the NPL in the fall of 2019. The remedial investigations at OU2 (the former Omaha & Grant Smelter) and OU3 (the former Argo Smelter) are ongoing, but there are known elevated levels of contaminants in groundwater and sub-surface soils in these areas. The main contaminants of concern at OU2 and OU3 are heavy metals including lead and arsenic. In OU2, land use determinations, and therefore potential human health exposures, are in flux due to development activities in the area. In OU3, the groundwater concentrations of arsenic, lead and cadmium are above the drinking water standards (MCLs). The groundwater in this area is not used for drinking however there are no institutional control to prevent contact or use with contaminated groundwater.<br/>To date, the planned activities to address these pathways are to collect samples in OU2 to complete the remedial investigation. At OU3, the next step is to complete the feasibility study. This study will evaluate possible alternatives to clean up OU3. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, you can contact the Community Involvement Coordinator for details. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by 12⁄31⁄2026 because it anticipates receiving funding and completing associated studies and cleanups by then.<br/>",

The planned activities to address the solid source pathway at the Town of Neihart Community Soils Operable Unit (OU) 1 are to implement the selected remedial action outlined in the 2009 Record of Decision (ROD) to remove residential soils contaminated with lead and arsenic, and to work with Cascade County Health Department to implement institutional controls. The cleanup standards in the ROD are 400 mg⁄kg for lead and 100 mg⁄kg for arsenic. <br/>EPA has also completed site-wide remedial investigations and is working on a solid source media feasibility study that addresses solid source mine waste and fluvial deposits in the Carpenter and Snow Creek watersheds. EPA will follow this with an interim Record of Decision to address the solid source media in Operable Unit 3 (Carpenter Creek), which is planned for December 2023. Another interim ROD addressing the solid source media in Snow Creek Operable Unit 2 is planned for December 2024. In addition, EPA and the US Forest Service have conducted multiple removal actions to reduce human exposure and address multiple safety hazards. These include on site demolition of degraded chemicals and dynamite, removal of electrical transformers containing PCB fluids, surface water diversions, and excavation and on-site placement of over 50,000 cubic yards of mine waste. EPA will continue to use removal authority to address the mine waste piles that have the greatest potential to erode in nearby surface water bodies until a final ROD can be issued in 2031. EPA is also working with two Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) to pilot test source control measures to address mine-influenced waters coming from two discharging mine adits in the Carpenter Creek (OU3) drainage. <br/>EPA continues to provide residents and recreationalists with information to reduce exposures to potentially contaminated sources such as soils, sediments, surface water and groundwater. Remedial action completion of a final aqueous (water) source remedy media is anticipated to be completed December 2040. This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because on site workers, residents and recreationalists can be exposed through direct contact to mine waste and sediment containing thallium, manganese, lead and arsenic in contaminated source materials, fluvial deposits and residential soils as well as mine influenced water discharging from multiple adits containing concentrations of lead, iron, zinc, cadmium, copper and thallium above federal maximum contaminant levels.<br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2022, the Hill Air Force Base Superfund site is considered “Current Human Exposure Not Under Control” (HENC). This is due to Vapor Intrusion (VI) both on and off Base which is being addressed under Operable Unit (OU) 15. The Remedial Action Objective of OU15 is to prevent human exposure by inhalation to indoor air concentrations that are present due to VI above the contaminants respective risk-based action levels. Action levels are based on a cancer risk of 1 in 100,000 or a Hazard Quotient of 1. The VI exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria. Some of the major contaminants of concern are TCE, PCE, VCL, and 1,2-DCA. OU15 is unique in that there is only one contaminated medium (indoor air) and one exposure pathway (inhalation). The vapor sources are being remediated as part of the other OUs for soil and⁄or groundwater contamination. Therefore, the remedy for OU15 focuses on preventing exposure and not treating the vapor sources.<br/>The OUs at Hill AFB which currently have vapor intrusion issues are OU1, OU2, OU5, OU6, OU8 and OU12. The affected areas have changed over time due to the changing footprints of the groundwater plumes over time and are anticipated to continue to change as the groundwater plumes continue to attenuate. Groundwater contaminated by solvents beneath buildings and homes is the main source of the vapors. OU1 and OU2, however, are a bit unique in that the VI is due to sewer gas. The vapors intrude into the basement through cracks and joints. Since initiating VI sampling, more than 11,000 VI samples have been collected from more than 3,000 individual locations. The Air Force has developed an ongoing yearly program to investigate as many as 2,400 buildings (residents and businesses) and install vapor intrusion mitigation systems (VIMS) as needed to protect human health.<br/>To date, 13,029 VIMS have been installed and all are at off-Base locations. The OU15 Record of Decision (ROD) was finalized on September 13, 2021. This ROD is very similar to the current Time-Critical Removal Action (TCRA) which started in 2003 and is currently in the process of being closed out.<br/>If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this site, under the current ROD, residents and business owners may contact the Base to have their properties sampled and a VIMS installed at no cost, if warranted. Hill AFB and EPA currently anticipate that human exposure will be under control by 12⁄31⁄2026 because expanded outreach efforts were developed prior to COVID- 19 to contact more residents face-to-face to obtain approval to sample their homes and businesses. The 2026 date may need to be reevaluated given the impact of COVID-19 home access challenges. <br/>",

The primary contaminants of concern are tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). The identified source of contamination is the historic dry-cleaning operation at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. The 700 South 1600 East PCE Site was finalized on the National Priorities List on May 24, 2013. As the lead agency, the VA completed a Remedial Investigation including Human Health Risk Assessment for Accelerated Operable Unit 1 (AOU1). This investigation focused on the vapor intrusion pathway for contaminants, which can occur in shallow groundwater and enter buildings through small cracks in the foundation. Of the residences tested, only one home required installation of a vapor mitigation system. Three additional residences were provided temporary controls. Subsequently, AOU1 was merged with groundwater OU2 to form a new site-wide OU1. <br/>To address this pathway, a comprehensive Remedial Investigation (RI) and Human Health Risk Assessment was completed for OU1 in September 2022, which evaluated the vapor intrusion pathway on a larger scale, as well as any potentially complete exposure pathways from groundwater and⁄or surface water. EPA anticipates that human exposure will be under control by 2026 (or sooner) when a final remedy is implemented. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this Site, the VA is currently providing free indoor air quality testing for homeowners. If warranted, the VA will provide a vapor extraction system at no cost. EPA will continue to ensure that any unacceptable exposures are addressed. Ongoing community outreach activities are being conducted at this Site.<br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2022, the Utah Power and Light⁄American Barrel Superfund site is considered “Insufficient Data to make a Human Exposure evaluation” (HEID). The Utah Power and Light⁄American Barrel Superfund site was evaluated in 2021 for its fifth Five-Year Review (FYR), and recommendations from that review indicate that there is insufficient data to make a Human Exposure determination.<br/>EPA uses this Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring, and that those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. As of September 2022, the planned activities to collect sufficient information to make a human exposure evaluation are to conduct a vapor intrusion study at the North Sixth Apartments. A vapor intrusion investigation was recommended during the 2016 fourth FYR, based on information identified during the 2011 vapor intrusion. In August 2018, PacifiCorp submitted a Response to Recommendation⁄Follow-up Action for Indoor Air Sampling and a Vapor Intrusion Investigation from the Fourth Five-Year Review, American Barrel Superfund Site. The Johnson and Ettinger model was used in this evaluation to determine if the soil vapor posed a potential risk to persons inside the North Sixth Apartments. Although residential units are not located on the first floor, to be conservative the Johnson and Ettinger model was run for a potential residential exposure. The model indicated that the concentrations detected in the soil-gas would not translate into a residential exposure above target levels. The report also identified difficulties in conducting vapor intrusion sampling due to elevated background benzene concentrations that would be present given the buildings urban location and the thickness of the building foundation (3 feet thick) that would prohibit sub-slab sampling. <br/>After reviewing the document and conclusions of PacifiCorps August 2018 response, the EPA and UDEQ determined that the Johnson and Ettinger modeling conducted would not be sufficient to determine risk posed by the vapor intrusion pathway. The EPA and UDEQ will require a comprehensive VI investigation, including indoor air sampling, to evaluate the vapor intrusion pathway for the North Sixth Apartments.  In April of 2022, PacifiCorp preformed a Vapor Intrusion investigation, but that test was inconclusive. A second round of testing is planned for the fall of 2022.   EPA and UDEQ currently anticipate that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure determination by December 1, 2022. This date is anticipated because it will provide the time to plan and implement a comprehensive vapor intrusion investigation and provide enough time to analyze the results.<br/>Note that this does not necessarily mean that unacceptable exposures are occurring.

PFAS are a group of man-made chemicals that includes PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and many other chemicals. Historic uses of aqueous Fire Fighting Foams are the source of PFAS at the base. The ongoing Remedial Investigation and well survey data for off-site domestic water indicate PFAS migration in ground water and surface water extends at least 30 miles off-base to the south and east. Beginning in October 2018, the Air Force started supplying alternative water where drinking water concentrations are above the EPA health advisory of 70 parts per trillion (ppt). Concentrations up to 13,870 ppt PFOA/PFOS were found in drinking water and 17,370 ppt in irrigation wells. <br/>Several Removal Actions have been taken to provide alternative water supplies, including bottled water, water filtration systems, larger treatment systems, or connecting to existing water lines. However, the Air Force ended restrictions on the use of drinking water wells in an area known to have high levels of PFOA⁄PFOS. Human exposure could come under control as soon as the extent of the plume is identified, alternate sources of drinking water are supplied, and ICs are implemented now tentatively estimated by 9⁄30⁄2027.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2022, the Anaconda Aluminum Co Columbia Falls Reduction Plant Superfund site is considered Current Human Exposure Not Under Control (HENC). A byproduct of the aluminum reduction process is spent pot liner (SPL), which is known to contain cyanide and fluoride. SPL was disposed of onsite in several landfills between 1955-1990. <br/>An Administrative Order on Consent for the Remedial Investigation (RI) and Feasibility Study (FS) was signed in late 2015. The RI Report was finalized on February 21, 2020, and the FS Report was finalized on June 16, 2021. The findings from the RI indicate that PAHs (soil and sediment), cyanide (groundwater), and fluoride (groundwater) are the Contaminants of Concern (COCs) that are the primary risk drivers at the Site. The results of the RI indicate that groundwater is the primary migration pathway for the potential transport of COCs from the various source areas. In addition, results indicate that cyanide and fluoride are the primary COCs from a contaminant migration⁄fate and transport perspective. The exposure pathways are considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because they contribute to risk estimates that exceed acceptable levels for potential human health risk (i.e., excess lifetime cancer risk of 1E-06 for carcinogens; or hazard index of 1 for non-carcinogens) or pose moderate or higher risk from the ecological perspective (i.e., lowest observed adverse effect level Hazard Quotient values greater than 1 for at least one receptor).<br/>To date, the planned activities to address this pathway will be identified and detailed in EPA’s proposed plan and Record of Decision. The proposed plan and Record of Decision are anticipated to be finalized by September 2023. EPA currently anticipates that human exposure will be under control by September 2031. In addition, the PRP implemented a time critical removal action in Fall 2020⁄Spring 2021 at the South Percolation Ponds. The South Percolation Ponds were the only feature within the River Area Decision Unit (DU) that contained sediments with COCs at concentrations exceeding preliminary remediation goals. This work was implemented in advance of FS completion to prevent erosion and transport of contaminated sediments by the Flathead River and was performed in accordance with the USEPA-approved Removal Work Plan.<br/>The PRP in consultation with the EPA and state partners, provides the community with information to reduce exposures to potentially contaminated sources. The PRP has implemented a robust community involvement program to communicate risk about the site. The PRP has been proactive in coordinating community involvement support with EPA. <br/>EPA’s site profile page (https://www.epa.gov/superfund/columbia-falls) is regularly updated with information on the status of the project.

The site was previously categorized as Human Exposure Under Control. EPA uses this HEID status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring, and that those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. Limited data is available on the basis of two Site Investigation-type investigations. The 2018 investigation found PFAS in ground water in several wells below the health advisory over a small area. However, the maximum concentration was close to the 70 ug/l health advisory. The Air Force augmented the data with an investigation in 2021 with similar results and one more well approaching the 70 ug/l. After this investigation, toxicological values were updated. The health advisory was lowered to 40 ug/l where concentrations at PJKS approached 60 ug/l. This exposure pathway evaluation is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based concentration levels. The concentrations in soil, ground water, and surface water need to be delineated and assessed for potential exposure risks.  <br/>To date, the planned activities to collect sufficient information to evaluate this new potential exposure are to conduct a remedial investigation (RI), which will include a Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) and⁄or information about the human interactions with potentially contaminated media. The PFAS contaminants may be co-mingled with contaminants in ground water associated with other Operable Units (OUs) on the base.

The OU1 Record of Decision Amendment issued in 2017 selected institutional controls as part of the OU1 remedy. This exposure pathway is considered unacceptable based on EPA risk-based criteria because of high concentrations of heavy metals, specifically arsenic and lead, in waste rock piles and groundwater in Belden and Rock Creek.<br/>To date, the planned activities to address this pathway are to coordinate with the State of Colorado and the property owner to implement a restrictive notice via the Colorado Environmental Covenant Statute to restrict access to the Belden and Rock Creek areas of the Site.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2022, the Lincoln Park Superfund Site is considered “Insufficient Data to make a Human Exposure evaluation” (HEID). Lincoln Park was finalized on the NPL in 1984. Because it was historically managed by CDPHE under a Consent Decree-Remedial Action Plan and Radioactive Materials License, there has not yet been a site-wide evaluation of the human health exposure risks under CERCLA. However, a human health exposure evaluation was completed for OU2 Soils & Sediment and found no unacceptable risk. A No Further Action ROD was signed for this area in 2002.<br/>EPA uses the HEID Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring, and that those exposures are above the acceptable risk-based levels. As of September 2022, the planned activities to collect sufficient information to make a human exposure evaluation are underway. A Human Health Risk Assessment to evaluate human interactions with potentially contaminated media including OU1 and OU3 soil, sediment, groundwater, surface water and air, and OU2 groundwater, is in progress and the results will be included in the Final Remedial Investigation Report. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure determination by September 2024.<br/>To date, EPA suspects that contaminant source areas are within the former Cotter Uranium Mill operations area. Primary contaminants of concern include radionuclides, heavy metals, TCE, and PCBs. The Remedial Investigation to document the site-wide nature and extent of contamination is underway. The risk evaluation team is evaluating the large amount of historic data, the quality of those data, and preparing a data gaps analysis to inform additional sampling. <br/>This does not necessarily mean that unacceptable exposures are occurring. If you are potentially impacted by risks inherent at this Site, please contact the EPA Project Manager (Rebecca Gerhart, 303-312-6695) or the EPA Community Involvement Coordinator (Ryan Kloberdanz, 303-312-6078). The Community Involvement team publishes a quarterly newsletter, holds an annual meeting, and has published several Fact Sheets for homeowners and realtors in the area.

Warren Air Force Base (Warren) Superfund site is considered “Insufficient Data to make a Human Exposure evaluation” (HEID) because of a newly identified potential exposure pathway and⁄or contaminant(s) known as per-fluor-alkyl substances (PFAS). At least three potential soil source areas were recently identified. PFAS are a group of man-made chemicals that includes PFOA, PFOS, GenX, and many other chemicals. The health advisory for drinking water is 40 ppt or 0.04 ug⁄l. Maximum concentrations in environmental media include: soils up to 3,400 ug⁄kg; ground water up to 2,011 ug⁄l; and one surface water detection of 112 ug⁄l. Historic uses of aqueous Fire Fighting Foams are the source of PFAS at the base. The site was previously categorized as Human Exposure Under Control. The concentrations in soil, ground water, and surface water need to be delineated and assessed for potential exposure risks.<br/>EPA uses this Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring, and that those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. As of September 2022, the planned activities to collect sufficient information to evaluate this new potential exposure pathway and⁄or contaminants(s) are to conduct a remedial investigation (RI), which will include a Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) and⁄or information about the human interactions with potentially contaminated media. The PFAS contaminants may be co-mingled with contaminants in ground water associated with the fourteen established Operable Units (OUs) on the base. One or more new OUs may be established to facilitate response actions. Direct soil exposure and ingestion of ground pathways must be evaluated.

The planned activities to address the pathways are a continuation of ongoing removal of soil contaminated with arsenic and lead. Additional actions include implementing health education and institutional controls at a local level. These programs will target the entire community and stakeholders, such as builders or others who disturb soil, informing them of the risks of exposure, methods to prevent exposure, and measures to control the future spread of contamination through education and best management practices. EPA has already begun cleaning up the contaminated soil. Cleanup actions have resulted in the remediation of 1,122 residential properties. EPA continues working in conjunction with local officials to assist in the health education and institutional control efforts that include the dissemination of relevant information and with future focus to incorporate building permit requirements, in addition to the possible use of deed restrictions and/or environmental covenants for residential properties with contamination left at depth.",

In 2015 the EPA funded a Cooperative Agreement with the City of Omaha for the Y sampling and remediation of contaminated soil within the Site. As of April 2023, 13,552 residential properties with lead contamination greater than 400 parts per million (ppm) have been identified and remediated. The Cooperative Agreement with the City of Omaha continues through December 2030. The City currently has 163 residential properties remaining to be sampled. The City continues to identify and to reach out to the owners of the  565 residential properties that have been sampled with lead contamination over 400 ppm and have refused remediation. The City has an extensive community outreach program providing lead information to diverse community groups. Through a separate Cooperative Agreement funded by the EPA, the Douglas County Health Department works with local WIC clinics and Head Start programs to evaluate children living within the Omaha Lead site for elevated blood lead levels. The DCHD compiles blood lead level data and reports to the EPA on the number of children tested each quarter. The DCHD also has an extensive outreach program that focuses solely on health care facilities, doctor offices, Head Start programs and WIC outreach programs. The Cooperative Agreement with the DCHD was renewed on October 1, 2022 for another seven years. The efforts by the City of Omaha and the data compiled by the DCHD are being used to help the EPA assess the effectiveness of the cleanup in the Omaha Lead Site. ",

Caney Residential Yards is the site of two former lead smelters, the American Zinc Lead Smelter Company and Owens Zinc Company Smelter, in the town of Caney, KS.  Lead is the main contaminant of concern due to air deposition of contaminants from smokestacks onto the surface of residential yards.  Smelter waste was also used as construction fill material and as a base for driveways, streets, and sidewalks.  Pathways of exposure include inhalation and ingestion of residential soil or smelter waste found in yards, parks, or school properties.  To date, the EPA has sampled 1,041 residential properties in Caney, Kansas, with 344 qualifying for and completing remediation of lead contamination in the soil greater than 400 parts per million. The Region 7 Interim Lead Policy has resulted in the RI/FS determination of 200 ppm lead as the Action Level for the IROD, signed on 9-26-22.

Contaminated soil and sediments pose a direct contact and ingestion threat to young children and pregnant women. The planned activities to address this pathway were a series of removal actions to stabilize waste piles, replace highly contaminated surface soil in residential yards and child high-use areas, and complete two remedial actions to address remaining yard soils (OU 1) and watershed sediments (OU 2). A total of 7,130 yards have been sampled. Of those 5,179 had one or more areas > 400 parts per million lead. A total of 2,419 properties have been remediated where high levels of lead were found in residential properties or where children with elevated blood lead were identified. Six of the seven mine waste piles are stabilized.  Surface water, sediment, and various forms of biota contain elevated concentrations of lead throughout the mining area. Fish in Big River have shown elevated concentrations of lead. Fish advisories have been in place at the site since 1981. EPA has worked with the St. Francois County Watershed Group, a group of local concerned citizens and other federal and state agencies, to help educate the community on the effects of lead contaminated soil, sediment, and surface water. Additionally, EPA plans to complete an Interim Record of Decision in 2025 to address lead-contaminated floodplain soil, surface water, and sediment in the Big River watershed from Leadwood to the confluence with the Meramec River. The planned activity to address the pathway for OU 1 is the continuation of ongoing remediation of lead contaminated soils. Additionally, the planned activities to address the pathway for OU 2 will be determined in the Interim Record of Decision for OU 2",

Lead-contaminated residential yard cleanups began in 2000 and are ongoing, several mine waste piles have been addressed and others are in the Remedial Investigation phase and remain to be addressed, and creek, river and lake sediments and floodplains are still contaminated in many areas. The EPA is currently developing a watershed model for the Little Saint Francis River as part of the RI activities to support long-term remedial action for the overall watershed. EPA is also performing an RIFS, projected completion 2025, to further characterize and determine an appropriate remedy.  Community involvement at the site currently occurs in the form of a quarterly, open round table meeting between federal, state, and local officials, as well as any interested members of the public.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2022, EPA has determined that \"Human Exposure Not Under Control\" at Jones Road Ground Water Plume Superfund Site because residents are dependent on private wells for their domestic water supply and can be exposed to chlorinated compounds in the groundwater plume. In November of 2008, an alternate water supply line was completed and 144 residential and commercial users were connected to a municipal water supply system. Half the residents chose not to be connected to the municipal supply and may still be exposed to the contaminated ground water. On September 29, 2017, EPA amended the Record of Decision to address two key soil zones, the Shallow Source Area Soil and the Deep Unsaturated Chicot Sand, with vapor-phase contaminant concentrations with the potential to impact the underlying groundwater in the “Shallow Water-Bearing Zone” (“Shallow WBZ”) and the “Deep Chicot Aquifer”. The purpose of the Selected Remedy is to implement a sitewide strategy to reduce the source of contaminants in the soil to the underlying groundwater. A door-to-door visit was conducted in November 2019 to encourage the property owners on private wells to sign-up to be on the waterline. After the door to door visit, 21 property owners gave access to sample their wells. These wells were sampled in February 2020 and four of them have site contaminant levels above MCLs. Three of the property owners use the well for lawn watering or shop cleaning purposes and do not use the well for drinking water purposes. One of the property owners process the water through a carbon filtration system before use.  There are other property owners will wells that did not give access to sample their wells. Follow-up phone calls were made in August 2020 with the property owners to determine their interest to be on the waterline and only 5 of them want to be connected to the waterline. In January 2021, July 2021, February 2022 – EPA sampled private water wells during the site semi-annual monitoring event. Sampling again showed PCE exceedances in the same four private water wells as the June 2020 sampling. EPA continues to notify these property owners of the sampling results, advise against the use of well water for drinking purposes, and offer connection to the waterline. February 2022 – EPA contacted White Oak Bend Municipal Utility District (WOB MUD) to resume conversations regarding providing additional waterline connections to the community. WOB MUD requested a list and number of residents that may require connection to the waterline. EPA provided preliminary information to the WOB MUD. EPA has actively pursued finalization of the list of residents that want to be connected to the waterline. However, EPA has been unable to finalize the list for various reasons as some of the residents wanted to wait until they received their sampling results and then decide; others were not sure if they want to be connected; some who previously expressed an interest in connecting to the waterline changed their position after seeing their sample results; and others changed their position for undisclosed reasons. EPA is in the process of securing contract support to assist in contacting community members. With contractor support EPA will request property owners to fill out the WOB MUD agreement form, and then finalize a list of owners that want to be connected to the waterline. Upon finalization of the list, EPA will provide the list to the WOB MUD to move forward with the waterline connections.",

The EPA completed the dredging of sediment in a half mile section of the canal with the highest concentrations of PCBs in May 2020.  Over time the concentrations of PCBs should begin to decline but this will likely take a number of years.  The EPA will continue to monitor PCB concentrations in sediment and fish tissue.  The EPA will also coordinate with the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) to evaluate the risk from consuming fish caught within the Donna Reservoir and Canal System Superfund Site.<br/><br/>An Institutional Control (IC), in the form of an aquatic life order, has been implemented at the Site for a number of years. The TDSHS issued “Aquatic Life Order Number 9” in February 1994. This order stated that “. . . the Donna Irrigation System [Donna Site] located in Hidalgo County is declared a prohibited area for the taking of all species of aquatic life.” According to a sign posted by the Texas Department of Health, predecessor to the TDSHS, at Donna Lake there is a $500 fine for keeping fish from the reservoir and canal system. This sign also states that, “Warning, it is illegal to possess fish from this water, fish caught from this water may contain harmful chemicals.” The enforcement authority for this order is the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (i.e., Game Wardens). The EPA expects that the TDSHS’s aquatic life order will remain in place until PCB levels in fish tissue are shown to have decreased to a level that is not an unacceptable risk.<br/><br/>Informational Institutional Controls (ICs) include the information distributed by the TDSHS concerning PCBs and the cooking options for fish caught from the Site. This document is titled “Guide on Fish Consumption and the Effects on Human Health” (Publication No. 09-14639, July 2015). To increase the awareness of the prohibitions concerning the taking of fish from the Site, the EPA will install and maintain warning signs for 5 years.  The EPA plan includes enhanced outreach efforts conducted by the EPA, TDSHS, and other entities associated with the Site. These outreach efforts will emphasize that the prohibitions will remain in place after the remediation of the Site until the Remedial Action Objectives identified in the Record of Decision have been achieved.<br/>",

The Soil Feasibility Study was completed in 2021; however, further investigation of the ground water is needed in order to fully evaluate potential response actions.<br/><br/>Properties of concerned residents were sampled in May/June 2015. Soil data from the residential areas was reviewed to assess the potential for immediate human health risks. All results and concerns were discussed with the residents in October 2015. At this time, no immediate health risks were identified. In addition, properties where refinery waste is present at the surface are fenced and locked to deter trespassing and potential contact with the refinery waste.<br/><br/>In September 2018, a Source Control Interim and Early Action Record of Decision was issued to address the lead additive area and 8 waste source areas.  The remedial design was completed in September 2019 and remedial action was funded in 2020; however, due to travel restrictions related to Covid-19 remediation was not completed in 2021. The Source control Interim and Early Action was completed in May 2023; however, this is only an interim/early action and only addresses exposures related to the 9 identified source areas and does not address all areas that need to be cleaned up.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2022, the South Cavalcade Street Superfund site is considered “Insufficient Data to make a Human Exposure evaluation” (HEID) because of a newly identified exposure pathway and/or contaminant(s). Coal tar seeps were observed at the Site for the first time since the remedy was implemented in July 2000. The tar seeps area is west of the southeast cap installed at the Site. Since July 2021, additional tar seeps were observed in the same area during the months of September 2021, October 2021, December 2021, and February 2022. These tar seeps occur in the truck parking lot where there is truck and pedestrian traffic. The source is presumed to be from residual coal tar pooled underground from pre-1962 coal tar distillation operations at the Site. The Potentially Responsible Parties (PRP) removed the exposed tar and pea gravel from the pavement area after each occurrence and placed them into a 55-gallon drum for proper disposal in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations. The PRP primed and sealed concrete joints in the tar seeps area in March 2022, as per an approved workplan.<br/><br/>The site was previously categorized Human Exposure Under Control (HEUC) and was changed to Human Exposure Saved Draft while the tar seeps were being evaluated. For the remedy at the Site to be protective the nature and extent of coal tar and soil contamination in the southeast is to be determined and remedial alternatives evaluated and implemented. In addition, indoor air quality in the nearby tractor trailer maintenance shop needs to be evaluated and addressed.<br/><br/>EPA uses this Human Exposure status when there is a lack of evidence to suggest that actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring and that those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. The planned activities to collect sufficient information to evaluate this new exposure pathway and/or contaminants(s) are for the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) to collect soil gas samples near the tractor trailer maintenance shop and perform a risk evaluation to determine whether vapor intrusion is an issue in the maintenance shop. The PRP needs submit a plan to evaluate the nature and extent of coal tar and soil contamination. Once the nature and extent is delineated, the PRP needs to implement response actions to address the tar and contaminated soil. EPA currently anticipates there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure evaluation by 6/30/2025 because EPA anticipates the coal tar delineation and vapor intrusion risk evaluation will be completed by then.<br/><br/>The property owner is providing access and has been cooperating with the EPA and PRP to resolve this issue expeditiously. prevent dermal and inhalation exposure.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of July 2023, the Tar Creek Superfund Site (Site) is considered Human Exposure Not under Control because people may be exposed to lead in soils, chat piles, chat bases, and mill ponds. Tribal members live throughout the area and utilize plants grown on or animals feeding near contaminated areas as a part of their tribal way of life. In addition to these exposures, there are adolescent recreators and families that continue to trespass and use the contaminated areas for recreational purposes.  The contaminated area is vast and it is not possible to prevent all access to the mining waste.  Consequently the EPA is implementing the cleanup of contaminated source areas and conducting multiple community outreach efforts to educate people with respect to avoiding exposure to the contamination. These actions will significantly reduce the exposure of Tribal members and trespassers to the contamination.<br/><br/>The voluntary buyout the EPA implemented under the Record of Decision for Operable Unit 4 (Mining Waste) in the former mining towns of Picher, Cardin, and Hockerville was completed in 2011. This effort relocated more than 700 residences. With this milestone achieved the continued remediation of residential properties, and the continued outreach efforts in adjacent communities that are within the Site's boundary, the EPA views the exposure to Site contamination to be under control in these areas.<br/><br/>With regard to potential human health risks related to surface water and sediment exposure, EPA is working with partners to address these concerns.  EPA Regions 6 and 7 are working closely with the 3 states (Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas), nine Tribes (Quapaw Nation, Peoria Tribe, Ottawa Tribe, Miami Tribe, Eastern Shawnee Tribe, Wyandotte Nation, Seneca-Cayuga Nation, Modoc Tribe, and Cherokee Nation), and the community to develop and complete a human health risk assessment and characterization report. This Operable Unit 5 (Surface Water and Sediment) effort includes seven watersheds covering approximately 437 square miles and 119 river miles within Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and 8 tribal areas.",

The source of the radon and progeny is a large tailing impoundment containing 21 million tons of radioactive uranium tailing.  The LTP has a final radon barrier in place along its flank, but only an interim soil cover on its top.  A final radon barrier and evapotranspiration cover design has been submitted by PRP to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for approval under the Uranium Mill Tailing Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA).  Once the final radon barrier is in place, EPA fully expects the radon and progeny emissions from the site will be reduced.  EPA has not selected a CERCLA remedy for the site to date, but a CERCLA feasibility study is being performed to identify remedial alternatives that will substantially achieve requirements of CERCLA and NCP for a CERCLA quality remedy.  It is noted that natural background radon levels in ambient air also pose an unacceptable risk to residents in the neighboring subdivisions. ",

Finally the area was graded, capped, seeded and the treatment unit was removed.   \r<br/>\r<br/>Addressing the groundwater was deferred in the original 1984 ROD until later.

(Please note:  by this time soils have been excavated, treated in the land treatment unit and returned to the place of excavation )  For two years, eight rounds of groundwater monitoring were conducted, and the shallow groundwater originally of concern meets now the State of Louisiana RECAP requirements.  No further action will be required for the gw.  The ROD was modified by an Explanation of Siginificant Differences signed on 9/12/2006, and a Final Close Out Report was signed on 9/12/2006.\r<br/>\r<br/>The site is in the construction completion list and a Five Year review will be conducted in 2007.\r<br/>\r<br/>Because the site is adjacent to the Levee of the Mississippi River, the US Army Corps of Engineers have limitations and permit requirements for any activity next to the levees.  The site is also capped, graded, seeded, therefore the State placed a conveyance notification that limits future use to avoid disturbing the cap.  These limit the future reuse potential.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2023, the Valley Pike VOCs Superfund Site is considered “Current Human Exposure Not Under Control” because groundwater, soil and indoor air have been contaminated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE). Data from 2011-2015 investigations led by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) have shown that indoor air at certain residences at the site has been contaminated by VOCs above the Ohio Department of Health screening levels. In 2013, the USEPA Removal Program began activities to address the vapor intrusion pathway by sampling at homes and installing vapor mitigation systems in homes where VOCs exceed public health screening level values. In January 2016, Mullins Rubber Products, Inc. agreed to conduct a removal action which includes evaluation and mitigation of residential vapor intrusion and a source control action under USEPA oversight. The removal action is ongoing and expected to continue until a remedy is selected in 2027. Currently the USEPA Remedial Program is reviewing plans submitted by Mullins Rubber Products, Inc. for the Remedial Investigation (RI) and Feasibility Study. The RI field work is expected to begin in 2023. There is limited data regarding groundwater contamination from Valley Pike VOCs, and the RI will include a comprehensive groundwater investigation to gather further information. The site is located near the Dayton Mad River Well Field to the south, and the Dayton Miami Well Field to the west. Collectively, these well fields provide drinking water for approximately 400,000 residents in Dayton and Riverside. Both towns' municipalities monitor the wells in their distribution system to ensure that safe drinking water is being provided to the residents.<br/><br/>USEPA prepared a Multi-Site Community Involvement Plan (CIP) to engage and support the community affected by three Superfund sites located in Montgomery County, Ohio. This CIP focuses on the Behr Dayton and Valleycrest Landfill sites in Dayton, and the Valley Pike site in Riverside. See the CIP at: https://semspub.epa.gov/src/document/05/919629. Outreach activities included an informal open house and public meeting, development and distribution of fact sheets for homes within the impacted neighborhood, and interviews regarding the contamination and removal efforts at the site. Since the NPL listing, USEPA representatives have met with the local council members and will continue to actively engage the community through the newly formed Community Advisory Group.<br/>",

There are several drains and streams that lead off-site and flow into the Detroit River. EPA signed an interim Record of Decision in September 2016 selecting an interim source control remedy addressing leachate from the on-site landfills and the tandem mill ponds. Leachate from the landfills has been shown to contain naphthalene, phenol, mercury, 2,4-dimethylphenol, barium, and cyanide, and currently has a pH greater than 12.5, classifying it as hazardous. Water from the ponds has been shown to contain phenols, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), metals, and high pH. The nature and extent of contamination at the site has not yet been determined, as the RI is ongoing. Additional sampling of groundwater, surface water and sediment was begun in 2018 and will continue through summer 2024. These data are currently being evaluated as received. This additional RI sampling will determine the extent of contamination. A human health risk assessment will be done to determine whether any identified exposures are within acceptable limits. The site is currently fenced but workers at the nearby mill have access to portions of the site. EPA is in regular contact with the Mayor of Gibraltar regarding the status of the project.

Additionally, EPA believes that PCB-contaminated fish from the Lange and Revere Street canals are being consumed. EPA conducted removal actions in 2014 and 2020 to address 18 properties with PCB concentrations exceeding removal action levels, but approximately 47 other known properties remain with PCB concentrations exceeding remedial action cleanup levels. EPA issued a Record of Decision in September 2018 for residential/commercial properties with contaminated near-surface soils, and EPA completed the remedial design for the 47 properties in January 2021. The remedial action cleanup of these properties is expected to start in the summer of 2023 and to be completed in the fall of 2024. EPA implemented an interim remedial action at the site in summer 2015 which removed highly impacted backfill and bedding materials adjacent to two manhole vaults and the 120-foot concrete pipe beneath Harper Avenue connecting those two vaults within the Ten Mile drain storm sewer system, including removal and replacement of the two manhole vaults and connecting pipe. In June 2023, EPA started the 30-day public comment period for the proposed plan to address the remaining PCB-impacted portion of the Ten Mile Drain storm sewer system with the ecord of Decision expected to be issued in late 2023. The next step would be for EPA to evaluate cleanup options for the PCB-impacted sediments in the Lange and Revere Street canal. EPA's site-wide human health risk assessment concluded that fish consumption by recreational anglers poses an unacceptable risk to human health. Fish in the Lange and Revere Street canals are contaminated above Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) health-based levels for human consumption due to PCBs, and an MDHHS \"do not eat\" advisory is in place for fish taken from the canals. EPA has observed people ice-fishing and believes the fish are being consumed. PCBs continue to infiltrate into the Ten Mile drain storm sewer system, which empties into the Lange and Revere Street canals connected to Lake St. Clair. The MDHHS periodically sends a mailing to the residents who live along the canals and to local schools, with the \"Eat Safe Fish\" guidelines for Lake St. Clair, and EPA hosts public meetings to provide updates on the progress of the Superfund site and upcoming activities.<br/>",

WPSC began the remedial investigation (RI) at the site in October 2014, separated into two separate reports:  upland soil and groundwater as operable unit 1 (OU1); and sediment as OU2. The WPSC Green Bay site is the WPSC headquarters and is located in an industrial park surrounded by buildings, parking lots, and a paved walking loop around the perimeter of the rivers' confluence. WPSC maintains the building and paved areas. The former gas plant was demolished, and some soil was excavated to build the headquarters and put down the parking lots and paved trail. The groundwater is not the source of drinking water; the confluence of the two rivers up to Lake Michigan is used primarily for commercial shipping purposes and it is not expected to see people use that part of the rivers for recreational purposes other than fishing. In 2014, EPA completed the Community Involvement Plan for the site. There are no nearby residential structures (approx. 0.5 miles away), WPSC owns the site property, and the groundwater plume spans additional corporate offices, parking lots, and a paved river trail outside the corporate complexes. The site is anticipated to be redeveloped to mixed-use residential. The RI work was placed on hold, as the potentially responsible party conducted sediment remediation in conjunction with the Fox River Superfund Site clean-up. In August 2021, an MGP-related sheen was observed at a location upriver of remediated areas in the East River, adjacent to the Site. A voluntary early removal action (ERA) on the northern portion of the upland area is projected to be complete by September 2023, which  includes source area excavation; removal of surface soils and fill material beneath the existing cap; treatment of impacted soils; backfill excavations with clean fill; and, removal of impacted sediment in the adjacent shoreline area where sheen was observed. The final OU2 Sediment RI Report is anticipated by November 2023. Additional RI work for OU1 is scheduled to be implemented in July 2023, and will be followed by the preparation of an OU1 RI Report. The final OU1 RI Report for the upland and groundwater areas is expected in June 2024.

Construction workers may be exposed via incidental ingestion of, dermal contact with, and inhalation of particulates and vapors from surface and subsurface soil, and via inhalation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the site while working inside construction trenches. The contaminants include VOCs, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). EPA's September 2017 Record of Decision describes the selected remedy to address these exposure pathways and includes the following: soil vapor extraction (SVE) to treat the VOCs where present in subsurface soil at depths that would make excavation infeasible; excavation of shallower contaminated soil for off-site disposal; and groundwater monitoring until remediation goals are met and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the soil remedy. There is fencing around two of the three facilities. One of these two facilities (MTS) is an active business; the other facility is unoccupied.

Subsequent cleanup phases have taken place in 2008 and 2010-2021. The combined cleanups have resulted in the removal of lead- and arsenic-contaminated soil from over 3,700 residential properties in Evansville. The United States Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a total of 5,300 residential properties will require  cleanup. Cleanup of the residential areas is on-going. Information availability sessions are held before and during the remedial work, and fact sheets are periodically mailed to inform residents of the risks associated with the contaminated soil and about the cleanup.",

The United States Environmental Protection Agency addressed the indoor air health risk by installing vapor abatement systems in 16 homes and at the St. Patrick Elementary School in the summer of 2007. VOCs have contaminated groundwater below the City of Troy as well as a local drinking water well field. Although EPA found no unacceptable risks to public health based on direct measurements of indoor air samples collected during the 2014 Remedial Investigation, EPA guidance allows for preemptive VI mitigation if sub-slab vapor concentrations are high and may pose a potential for future unacceptable risk. The activities to address the vapor intrusion pathway included a Focused Feasibility Study which evaluated potential remedial actions and was completed in 2017. A Proposed Plan was released for public comment in early June 2018 followed by a public hearing in late June 2018. The Interim Source Area Record of Decision was issued in September 2018, which includes the installation of sub-slab depressurization systems at all homes above the groundwater treatment area plus homes within a three block buffer. Implementation of the remedy is expected to be completed by the end of 2027.

Contamination at the site was initially discovered in 1996, when a concerned citizen contacted the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) with complaints of skin irritation caused by water drawn from a private residential well. IDEM obtained 19 drinking water samples from residential wells and six subsurface soil samples from nearby properties. Volatile organic compounds, including tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene and dichloroethylene were found in the residential well samples. In five homes, contaminants exceeded the Safe Drinking Water Act Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs). IDEM currently provides point-of-entry carbon filters to the residential homes with wells that had contamination approaching or exceeding the MCLs. While investigations have identified some potential sources of contamination, the origin of the contaminants has not been determined. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) added the North Shore Drive site to the National Priorities List (NPL) of Superfund sites on September 16, 2014. USEPA initiated a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility (RI/FS) in July 2017. The potential human exposure pathways include ingestion of potentially contaminated groundwater or direct contact with potentially contaminated soils. The RI/FS is expected to be completed by July 2025 at which time sufficient data is expected to be available to determine the human exposure under control status.<br/>",

The M&H facility was historically used primarily for mining and smelting activities and is currently inactive, except for a portion operated by Carus Chemical Company which was never involved in smelting activities. The site includes a large residential area (approximately 5,000 homes) surrounding the former facility. A remedial investigation (RI), which included testing a few hundred of the residential properties, was finalized in 2012. After completing the feasibility study, EPA issued a Record of Decision in April 2017 which selected remedies for all areas of the site. Thousands of properties will need to be tested during the remedial design (RD) to determine which properties require cleanup. EPA started the RD sampling in March 2018, and will conduct the RD and remedial action cleanup work in phases. Given the extent and cost of the required cleanup work, it will be a number of years before the human exposure control status will be considered \"under control.\" During the proposed plan public comment period, EPA held two public meetings and an informational session informing residents of the potential contamination in the residential area. EPA held additional information sessions at the start of the RD in 2018 and again in 2019, and will continue to hold periodic information sessions throughout the project. In addition, EPA has mailed information to residents informing them about safe gardening practices to minimize ingestion of contaminated soil and ways to reduce other exposures to contaminated soil. The RD sampling conducted so far identified several residential properties with soil concentrations exceeding removal management levels. Some of those properties were cleaned up during the summer of 2018 in a time-critical removal action and the remainder will be cleaned up during the remedial action. EPA began the remedial action cleanup work within the residential area of the site in summer 2019 and will continue cleanup work each year until the remedial action is complete.<br/>",

In 2002 and 2003 a removal action was conducted by the potentially responsible parties to address lead contamination in residential yards, commercial lots, and vacant lots. Some contaminated residential yards were not cleaned up during the removal action because the owners refused access for the cleanup work. In addition, the March 2009 Remedial Investigation Report documents concentrations of metals, including lead, zinc, cadmium, and arsenic, that exceed long-term health-based limits for human exposure in soils in several other residential yards, vacant lots, and alleyways near the site.

The NTCRA began September 2016 and was completed in December 2018. EPA is currently working on a proposed plan for the remaining portion of the creek. The ROD is estimated to be complete in March 2024. The cleanup which is estimated to be completed in 2027; however, it will take several years following the clean up for the PCB levels in fish to decline. <br/>",

During the remedial action, approximately 33,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediments were dredged from the Upper River and approximately 50,000 cubic yards were dredged from the Lower River and Inner Harbor. The remedial action sediment dredging work in the river was completed in December 2012. Monitored natural recovery is the selected remedy for the Middle River. Although the active cleanup work is complete, it will take some time for sediments to reach the selected long-term cleanup level and for fish tissue concentrations to decrease. Fish are sampled annually to monitor levels of PCBs. In addition to the long-term recovery in the river, additional PCB contamination has been found in soils at the former Tecumseh facility.

The investigation to address this pathway is on-going. The presence of 1,4-dioxane has been confirmed in on-site monitoring wells and downgradient private wells have been impacted. Known impacts to private wells have been provided bottled water and are being connected to municipal water. The private well investigation is on-going. The activities planned to make the human exposure determination include a VI investigation; an outdoor air investigation; continuing the 1,4-dioxane investigation; and updating the risk assessments, if applicable. Planning and implementation of these investigations are underway. The United States Environmental Protection Agency expects to be able to complete these investigations, and to make a determination on the site-wide Human Exposure Control status by the end of December 2024.<br/>",

The site was split into two Operable Units (OUs). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is the lead agency for OU1 (also known as the Electric Machinery area of the Site) and the State is enforcement lead agency for OU2 (also known as the Burlington Northern area of the Site). The state has requested that EPA take over the lead-agency role for OU2, and that is expected to occur approximately by February 2025. The 2020 Five-Year Review Report concluded that there was insufficient data to evaluate potential vapor intrusion risk for commercial/industrial buildings that are located above the contaminated groundwater plume. Under USEPA oversight, the potentially responsible parties have been conducting a vapor intrusion investigation which should be complete by May 2024.  In February 2022, the Minnesota Department of Health sampled for and found per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) present at the Waite Park municipal wells at low levels. USEPA is working to gather additional data to determine if the PFAS detected at the wells is related to the Waite Park Wells Superfund Site and to evaluate if it presents a risk to the community.  Informational mailings and meetings are used to keep the public informed of potential site risks and site cleanup progress.<br/>",

Groundwater, soil, and soil vapor are contaminated by trichloroethene (TCE), dichloroethene (DCE), and vinyl chloride. The potential human exposure pathways include ingestion of groundwater or soil, and inhalation via the vapor intrusion pathway. In 1983 a Groundwater Health Advisory Area was established by the State and requires all residents and businesses in the Advisory Area be connected to the municipal water supply. Except for a commercial property (currently unoccupied) and one resident (recent sampling of private well shows water meets applicable standards), all were hooked up to the municipal water supply. Remedial actions are underway addressing contaminated groundwater and soil. To determine the Human Exposure Under Control status, further information will be obtained by completing assessments for the vapor intrusion pathway. The vapor intrusion assessments are expected to be completed by 08/31/2025 at which time there should be sufficient information to determine the Human Exposure Under Control status for the site.<br/>",

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) transferred the site to EPA lead on October 25, 2022. Prior to that MPCA oversaw installation of vapor mitigation systems by General Mills for approximately 160 homes. MPCA requested that General Mills conduct additional sampling and/or mitigation for several properties. But General Mills stopped work and believes that a nearby upgradient site, Southeast Hennepin Area Groundwater and Vapor, now added to the National Priorities List as of March 2022, listing is the source of remaining TCE. MPCA is pursuing legal action against General Mills for noncompliance with the Consent Order. MPCA has been pursuing access with approximately 10 remaining property owners for property affidavits. MPCA has sent informational letters to all remaining property owners and is coordinating with the City of Minneapolis and Minnesota Public Health Department to sample properties and install additional mitigation, as needed, by the end of December 2023. EPA is currently planning to begin a Remedial Investigation at the Southeast Hennepin site in the fall of 2023. Additional work for the General Mills/Henkel site will be conducted in conjunction with that investigation work. <br/><br/>",

The site is very large, and includes about 46 river miles, associated floodplains and portions of Saginaw Bay. Effective in January 2010, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) negotiated a Settlement Agreement with the Responsible Party and the State, and a site investigation is underway. Dioxins (primarily furans) are the primary contaminants of concern and are in the river sediment, banks, floodplain soils, and fish. The Responsible Party is investigating the extent of contamination, and in 2021 completed the “Post-Construction Residual Human Health Risk Assessment for Tittabawassee River Segments 1 through 7” that concluded that current human health risks in and along the Tittabawassee River are within or below USEPA’s acceptable risk range. USEPA will work with the State to evaluate if additional measures are needed to control potential future exposures. The Responsible Party continues to investigate the Saginaw River and Bay and will use that information to conduct a future risk assessment. Since 2007, USEPA has signed fifteen Settlement Agreements with the Responsible Party to implement removal actions that contribute to control of human exposures. Cleanup of sediment deposits and river banks is controlling secondary sources that contribute to bioaccumulation in fish and downstream contaminant transport. USEPA provides funding to local partners to conduct education and outreach to encourage compliance with site-related fish and wild game consumption advisories. Prior to the final cleanup, human exposures at eligible residential and public use properties along the Tittabawassee and Saginaw Rivers have been mitigated by requiring interim exposure controls. In January 2015, USEPA selected a final cleanup plan for the Tittabawassee River floodplain, and executed a Settlement Agreement with the Responsible Party requiring cleanup of properties that exceed site-specific dioxin soil cleanup numbers. Most of the 700+ properties in the 4,500-acre floodplain have been evaluated and more than 100 have been provided a cleanup. The multi-year floodplain cleanup will ensure that all people who contact floodplain soil are protected. Floodplain property cleanups started in 2015 and is are expected to continue through 2024. In 2020, USEPA working with the State, selected a cleanup plan for residential properties and cleanup at 18 properties was completed in 2022. Owners have been provided with interim exposure controls in the meantime. Once the source of contamination, floodplain soil and sediment, has been cleaned up, it will take some time for fish tissue concentrations to decrease.<br/>",

The Pine River currently has a \"do not eat\" fish advisory which has historically been linked to the former Velsicol Chemical Corporation site, also linked to the Gratiot County Golf Course site.  The fish are contaminated with bioaccumulative compounds (DDT and PBB) at levels that present a risk to human from fish ingestion.  Although fish consumption advisories are in place in the River by the State of Michigan and warning signs are posted; fishing has been observed in the River, and we believe the fish are being consumed.   Site groundwater is contaminated, but the contamination has not reached the city of St. Louis municipal wells.  Contaminated groundwater may be discharging into the Pine River.  \r<br/>\r<br/>Although the Gratiot County Golf Course site was deleted from the NPL in 1983, it was placed back on the NPL in March 2010.  The site is being investigated by the State of Michigan as part of an ongoing investigation for OU1 of the Velsicol Chemical Corp site.  The state released the Investigation Report for OU1 (November 2006) and a subsequent Addendum in January 2009, and the former burn area at the Golf Course Site is included as part of OU1.  The Feasibility Study for the cleanup is currently under development.\r<br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of July 2023, the site-wide Human Exposure Control status at the Charlevoix Municipal Well Superfund Site is not under control because of a newly identified exposure pathway. This pathway is related to the volatilization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the subsurface. The contaminants of concern include trichloroethylene (TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in the soil and the groundwater. The chemicals were used in dry cleaning and manufacturing industries. The sources of the VOCs appear to include solvent tanks, contaminated soils and groundwater. The main exposure pathways of concern include the inhalation of contaminated soil gas or sub-slab vapors that become entrained into buildings (vapor intrusion) resulting in the greatest risks at the site. Via a time-critical removal action initiated in 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has removed the contents of three solvent tanks and installed sub- slab depressurization systems  in occupied buildings to address immediate threats. On April 8, 2020, EPA issued a decision document selecting an interim remedy to address the source of the (above mentioned) newly identified risk of exposure. Design and implementation of the selected remedy are proceeding as funding has been made available. EPA is working with property owners to acquire the properties necessary for the excavation of contaminated soils in source areas. EPA is also working with the City of Charlevoix to develop an institutional control ordinance to mitigate exposures during source area excavations.<br/>",

MPCA began an investigation in 2014 to identify the source(s) of contamination. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed the site on its National Priorities List (NPL) in May 2018, which will allow it to conduct a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) to provide information on the extent of contamination at the site and explore options for any needed clean up. EPA will complete the RI/FS; it is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, at which time the Human Exposure Under Control status can be determined.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2023, there is not sufficient information available to determine the site-wide Human Exposure Control status at the Chem Central Superfund Site because of a newly identified exposure pathway related to the volatilization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the subsurface. The contaminants of concern (COCs) include trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and vinyl chloride in the groundwater. Additional constituents found in groundwater include isopropylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. PCE and TCE degradation byproduct cis-1,2-dichloroethene was detected at concentrations exceeding Maximum Contaminant Level. The sources of the VOCs appear to include contaminated soils and groundwater. The main exposure pathways of concern include the inhalation of contaminated soil gas or sub-slab vapors that become entrained into buildings (vapor intrusion) resulting in the greatest risks at the site. A draft vapor intrusion investigation report was completed by the potentially responsible party (Univar) in 2021. EPA has requested follow-up sampling from some sampling locations in order to determine whether there is a complete vapor intrusion pathway posing an unacceptable risk to human health. Further information was obtained by taking the following actions: collected sub-slab and/or indoor air samples as needed to evaluate the vapor intrusion pathway at select locations and completed a vapor intrusion evaluation to determine whether an unacceptable risk to human health is posed. EPA has the sampling results and an evaluation of the vapor intrusion pathway which are under review.  EPA expects to be able to make a determination about the Human Exposure Control status at the Chem Central Site by December 30, 2023. <br/>",

There are soils on-site contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), for which soil vapor extraction (SVE) was selected as the remedial action in a 1998 interim Record of Decision. The SVE system was installed and was operating but is currently shut down. A Record of Decision was issued in September 2007 identifying the final remedy for the site to address remaining contamination in site soil, soil vapor, and groundwater. Additional contamination was discovered at the site in 2014. Data collection is being conducted before the remedial action can move forward. An Explanation of Significant Differences was signed in 2018 and addresses the increase in volume for soil excavation. Data collected to determine if surrounding residences or commercial/industrial buildings have unacceptable levels of indoor vapor intrusion from site-related VOC contamination shows inconclusive results. The State will be conducting an additional vapor intrusion investigation and expects to know whether vapor intrusion is a problem by the end of 2024. The community is kept up to date on the site and any potential site risks through mailings of factsheets and public meetings. The data collected from the vapor intrusion investigations was communicated to the specific residents and business owners who were participants.<br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of October 2022, the Allied Paper Inc./Portage Creek/Kalamazoo River Superfund Site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because the fish in the river are contaminated above health-based levels for human consumption due to PCB contamination. Although there is a fish advisory for the river, and warning signs posted along the floodplains, there is evidence of subsistence fishing from the river. The warning signs have been vandalized in the past and repaired by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes & Energy. In addition, in the floodplains along several miles of the river there may be PCB-contaminated soils above health-based limits for direct contact for recreational users. A large portion of this land is owned by the State; there is evidence that this property is used as a recreational area, but it is not practical to fence all the floodplain areas or to keep people out of these areas. EPA has conducted or directed several removal actions in and along the river and expects to continue using its removal authority, in addition to its remedial authority, to reduce human exposures due to these exposure pathways. From 2007-2009, an excavation and dredging removal action was conducted in a portion of the river near Plainwell, MI, and 130,000 cubic yards (CY) of PCB-contaminated sediment was removed. A second removal action in the river near the Plainwell No. 2 Dam area was conducted in 2009-2010 and removed 14,000 CY of PCB-contaminated soil and sediment. A third removal project was conducted in 2011-2013 and removed 23,700 CY of PCB-contaminated sediment from Portage Creek. A fourth removal action in the river near the Otsego Township Dam area began in August 2016 and was completed in August 2018, and removed approximately 33,000 CY of PCB-contaminated soil and sediment. A fifth removal action in the river near the Trowbridge Dam began in April 2020 and is expected to be completed in 2025. Approximately 75 additional miles of contaminated river sediments remain to be addressed. A supplemental Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study in the Kalamazoo River is ongoing. In September 2015, EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the first river area (Area 1), which includes Portage Creek. That remedy began in 2020 and will be completed in 2028. EPA issued a ROD for Area 2 in September 2017 and that Area is currently under remedial design. EPA issued a ROD for Area 3 in June 2022, and once the revised Consent Decree is entered NCR Corporation will implement the remedy. Investigative activities for Area 4 began in 2014 and were completed in November 2018, with the feasibility study of cleanup alternatives underway. Investigative activities for Area 5 began in 2017 and were completed in 2020. Investigative activities for Area 6 began in 2022 and will continue through 2025. Investigative activities for the entire river will extend until 2030. Public education and outreach will continue as the cleanup progresses at the site. Even after cleanup work is complete, it will take some time for fish tissue concentrations to decline.<br/>",

The contaminants include trichloroethylene (TCE), vinyl chloride (VC), and 1,2-dichloroethylene (1,2-DCE). In September 2019, EPA collected groundwater samples from the onsite monitoring wells. Analytical results indicate a concentration of 156,000 micrograms per liter of TCE in a shallow well adjacent to the building. The property owner voluntarily installed a sub-slab depressurization system (SSDS) in sections of the building; however, the necessity or effectiveness of SSDS has not been evaluated. The planned activities to address this exposure pathway include evaluating the vapor intrusion pathway and the SSDS system that the property owner installed. These activities are expected to be completed by the end of September 2025 at which time EPA expects to be able to determine the Human Exposure Control status.<br/>",

(Michigan) site is considered \"human exposures are not under control\" until the completion of the remedy on the former Site plant property. The former Site plant property is fenced but hazardous chemicals remain uncontrolled on-site under an inadequate landfill cap. Hazardous substances that have been released at the Site in soil, sediment and groundwater include dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polybrominated biphenyls, hexabromobenzene, 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane and chlorobenzene, among others. In June 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency signed a Record of Decision for the former plant property. While fish tissue data has shown a significant decrease in DDT concentrations as a result of the sediment clean up, fish consumption advisories remain in place for the Pine River fish. Warning signs advising against eating fish are also posted at river access points. The remedial action objectives include prevention of ingestion, inhalation, and direct contact of site-related contaminants of concern in soil and groundwater to human and ecological receptors. At the former plant property, the two largest contaminated areas are referred to as Areas 1 and 2. The in situ thermal treatment of Area 1 and Area 2 is complete.  The remedial action for the excavation and off-site disposal of 100,000 tons of contaminated soil (Potential Source Areas 1 & 2) has begun and is expected to be completed in late 2023. A number of pre-design investigations are underway and include groundwater modeling for a groundwater pump and treatment system, pre-design for using in-situ chemical oxidation at an area on the site, pre-design investigation for a groundwater collection trench, pre-design for the installation of a vertical barrier wall surrounding the 52-acre site, the construction of a groundwater pump and treatment system, and the construction design of an engineered cap.

Despite a state-issued fish consumption advisory, fishing has been observed in the creek.  We believe fish are being consumed by sport fishermen.  There are frequent community meetings to discuss site conditions and progress.  There is a community wepage that serves to distribute site information.\r<br/>\r<br/>Source area hot spots were removed, and the landfill was capped in 1999.  A water treatement plant to address the continuing release of PCBs was constructed in 1987.  A Record of Decision Amendment ot address improvements to the water treatment plant and contaminated sediment was signed in September 2007.  Neal's Landfill along with Bennett's Dump and the Lemon Lane Landfill are part of a Consent Decree which is being negotiated.  A settlement is expected by December 31, 2007 and design will begin in January 2008.  construction is expected to begin late 2008.\r<br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2023, there is insufficient information to determine the site-wide Human Exposure Control status at the Gary Development Landfill Superfund Site. In 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) signed an Administrative Order on Consent for a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS). The human health risk assessment identified polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminated sediments in the northern pond and southern wetland may cause an unacceptable risk to human health. There is a potential risk to site trespassers and recreational users of the river who may come into contact with contaminated sediments through direct contact. A gate and signs were installed along the southern portion of the site in June 2016 to prevent access. However, the site can still be accessed along the north and east boundaries where potential evidence of trespassing was observed and “no trespassing” signs were posted. The Indiana State Department of Health currently has a \"\"do not eat\"\" fish consumption advisory in place for the Grand Calumet River. However, people could be exposed to contaminants in the river (from this site and other nearby pollution sources) if they fail to heed the advisory and eat contaminated fish or contact contaminated sediments. It is unknown how much this site is contributing to the need for the fish consumption advisory. Additionally, chemicals have been detected at concentrations posing potentially unacceptable risks to human health in samples from groundwater monitoring wells along the perimeter of the landfill waste boundary, and no wells have been sampled beyond the property boundary. Potential exposure from vapor intrusion has not been evaluated outside the source area. Starting in August 2023, groundwater within the landfill waste boundary will be monitored quarterly and then biannually through landfill cap construction. Following eight quarterly rounds of groundwater monitoring post-cap construction, a determination will be made as to whether a groundwater investigation and human health risk assessment outside the property boundary will be required to make a human exposure determination.  EPA anticipates having sufficient information to make a human exposure determination by July 2032 as part of the selected remedy for the site. <br/>",

The main contaminants of concern (COCs) include trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethene (PCE), chloroform and vinyl chloride. A VI investigation work plan was approved and field investigations began in 2016. Eight (8) rounds of seasonal VI investigations have taken place in multiple buildings at the Site through 2021 in three (3) areas of the Site (One Line North, One Line South & Two Line North.) To ensure that indoor air detections of contaminants were not related to VI,  additional indoor and outdoor air sampling, water sampling and product testing occurred in 2022. The VI investigation results and evaluation are currently under review and a FYR Addendum is being prepared to provide the results of the 2022 investigations. The United States Environmental Protection Agency expects to complete the review and be able to make a determination on the site-wide Human Exposure Control status by the end of December 2023 at which time the Human Exposure Control status will be updated.<br/>",

Those impacts were found in above ground soil piles and at the ground surface, and do not appear to have been addressed under the original Record Of Decision. Deed restrictions do not appear to have been enforced at the local or state level, resulting in the issuance of a residential building permit and well permit, neither of which are allowed by the on-site deed restriction. The extent of lead contamination is not currently defined, and access agreements are being completed to perform sampling. Planned activities to further address the impacts include a preliminary assessment of the surficial contamination in mid-June 2023, and additional investigation work is in the preparatory phase of contracting. The removal program plans to contract for seeding of impacted soil piles as a temporary control for direct contact while further delineation will commence under a new Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study task order to be issued 2023.

The 2023 Five Year Review (FYR) found that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were detected in on-site leachate, but it is not known whether the PFAS are migrating into groundwater or whether there are any remaining well users that could be impacted. It is also unknown if 1,4-dioxane is present in the leachate and migrating into groundwater. The FYR also found landfill gas (LFG) in two on-site passive gas vents above explosive levels. One gas vent is adjacent to the underground leachate collection system, and it is not known whether the LFG poses an explosive hazard to the on-site waste hauler or other maintenance workers. Trichloroethene and vinyl chloride were also detected in LFG in 2003, and it is not known whether the LFG poses an explosive or inhalation risk to adjacent residents through VI.<br/><br/>The activities planned to make the human exposure determination include: 1. A PFAS groundwater investigation; 2. Sampling leachate for 1,4-dioxane; 3. Off-site well inventory; 4. Development and implementation of a plan for regular LFG monitoring; 5. Evaluating explosive and VI risks to on-site workers and current and potential future residents; and 6. Off-site institutional controls evaluation if warranted based on the results of the groundwater and LFG investigations.<br/>",

Removal actions were completed at nine of the areas and remedial actions were completed at six of the areas. Current human exposures are under control in these fifteen areas. EPA prioritized the cleanup of those sites because they are in more densely populated areas. The one remaining area, NPL-8 (Frontage Property/Landfill), is designated as \"Current Human Exposures Not Under Control\" because of the potential for exposure via direct contact, ingestion and/or inhalation to trespassers, construction workers, and/or commercial/industrial workers to radium contaminated soils. Phase one of remedy implementation at the NPL-8 Frontage Property has been completed as of August 2021. EPA has not implemented the remedy at NPL-8 Landfill. In 2022, the site received Biden Infrastructure Law (BIL) funds to complete the remedial action at NPL-8 Frontage Property and the NPL-8 Landfill. The work is expected to be completed in 2028.  Site security measures are in place with NPL-8 surrounded by a fence. Periodic inspections show that the structural integrity of the fence is in good condition and there is no evidence of trespassing. NPL-8 is covered with a dense vegetation. No soil disturbances have been observed at NPL-8.<br/>",

Surface and subsurface soil samples at residential properties in Operable Unit (OU) 4 exceed health-based residential screening levels for lead, arsenic, and cadmium based on data presented in the 2011 Removal Action Limit Assessment Report as well as the 2013 Off-Site Soils Pilot Study Report. Samples were collected from 41 out of 814 properties, including garden areas at 14 properties. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in June 2017 for portions of OU4 that requires excavation of metals-contaminated soils at residential properties, parks, and alleys. At the request of Illinois EPA, U.S. EPA assumed the role of lead agency in October 2019. EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to the OU4 potentially rsponsible parties to implement the 2017 ROD. Remedial Action began in July 2020 and will continue until all properties that require remediation have been remediated. As of June 2023, 95 residential properties still need to be sampled. Of the properties sampled to date, 130 need to be remediated. An interim remedy was completed at OU1 in the early 2000s and OU2 has recently been capped in accordance with Illinois EPA landfill regulations. OUs 3 and 5 are currently in the Remedial Investigation (RI) phase and the RI reports are expected to be complete by 12/31/23. The RI in OU6 will begin following the conclusion of the residential sampling in OU4. To inform the public of potential risks at the site, a Citizens Advisory Group meets regularly to keep the public informed of issues related to the site. Public meetings and availability sessions have been held by U.S. EPA, and several fact sheets and mailings have also been distributed throughout the community. Ongoing community outreach includes public meetings and informational mailings. <br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of July 2023, the Sandoval Zinc Superfund Site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because soil at some residential properties contains concentrations of lead and other metals that exceed health-based levels. Concentrations of lead at some properties are well above 400 parts per million (ppm), the EPA Region 5 current interim default lead cleanup number for residential exposure. EPA conducted lead bioavailability testing during the summer of 2017. While doing so, EPA identified several properties, including those with sensitive populations, with lead concentrations exceeding EPA’s removal management levels. EPA conducted a time-critical removal action at 10 properties during the fall of 2017. EPA has conducted extensive outreach to inform the community about site status and how to mitigate the risks posed by lead-contaminated soil through public meetings and the dissemination of informational sheets developed with ATSDR. EPA issued the Interim Record of Decision (ROD) on September 30, 2022. The cleanup, required by the interim ROD,  will address contaminated soil from the Village of Sandoval, the former smelter property, and adjacent areas, all of which were impacted by the former smelter. Waste at the former smelter property will be consolidated on-site in a new landfill. Village Soils, except those that are considered hazardous waste, will transported to the former smelter property for disposal.  Village Soils which are proven hazardous will be disposed of off-site in a hazardous waste landfill. EPA expects to start the remedial design in mid-to-late 2023. The remedial design and remedial action cleanup work should take approximately seven years.<br/>",

The following six volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were identified as COCs in groundwater: 1,1,1,-tricloroethane, chloroform, tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), vinyl chloride and benzene. These six VOCs were identified as COCs in vapor, based on soil vapor, sub slab, and indoor air screening although only two of these, TCE and PCE, were confirmed to have a complete vapor intrusion pathway. A Record of Decision for Interim Action was finalized in September 2014 and provides for municipal water supply connections to all residents on groundwater within the plume area and provides for installation of vapor intrusion mitigation systems to individual homes with a complete pathway for vapor intrusion exposure. A Consent Decree with the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) was entered on March 29, 2016 to complete the municipal water hookups to, and install vapor mitigation systems in homes in the main groundwater plume area and vapor intrusion zone. The municipal water connections have been completed. Vapor intrusion confirmation sampling is being conducted as access to residences is provided, and mitigation systems are being installed where needed. Vapor Intrusion Mitigation System Installations are expected to be completed by the end of February 2024.  Public outreach and education will continue as the cleanup progresses. <br/>",

Phase I of the removal consisted of on-site treatment by thermal desorption, and off-site landfill disposal. Phase II of the removal is limited to off-site landfill disposal.   EPA is addressing the current human exposure through the time-critical removal.   Fish advisories were also issued to warn the public not to eat contaminated fish from adjacent waterways.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2023, the Macon Naval Ordnance Plant site is considered Insufficient Data to Determine Human Exposure Control status because the Human Health Baseline Risk Assessment (HHBRA) has not yet been completed. Contaminants of Potential Concern include trichloroethylene (TCE) and other Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). EPA has negotiated with the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) to perform the Remedial Investigation (RI) and Feasibility Study (FS), which will include a HHBRA.  The RI/FS is expected to be completed in December 2023.  In 2015 and 2016, EPA found unacceptable levels of TCE in indoor air at two buildings on the site.  At that time, EPA worked closely with the business owners to implement engineering controls that successfully mitigated TCE concentrations in indoor air to safe levels for site workers. However, in January 2020, unacceptable levels of TCE were again found in the Unit 6 building. In Dec. 2021 that building had a sub-slab depressurization system installed to mitigate the risk and the sampling results confirm that the indoor air mitigation has been successful in returning the air quality to acceptable levels. Groundwater at the site is not used for drinking water and PCBs in site soils are below commercial risk but data is being reviewed to determine if all human exposure pathways have been evaluated.  EPA has prepared a Community Involvement Plan, and on November 12, 2019, a joint public availability session was held that addressed both the Macon Naval Ordnance Plant and Armstrong World Industries sites. On January 27, 2023, the EPA also attended an availability session, hosted by the GADOH, to inform workers at the Unit 6 building of the vapor mitigation status at that building.",

Removal activities consisted of excavation of soil and sediment contaminated with Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) in the Highland Industries property, a segment of the nearby ditch (approximately 1900 feet long), a section of the ditch adjacent to Pecan Dr., and Huckleberry Park. There is insufficient data to determine the human exposure site status because no comprehensive evaluation of the human health exposure pathway has been conducted yet.

The OU1 RI is scheduled to be completed in Winter 2024. Additional RIs for the east and west gypsum stacks and adjacent water bodies (Bayou Casotte and Grand Bay Estuary) are scheduled to begin by Winter of 2025. Concurrently, a Non-Time Critical Removal is being conducted to cap the large east gypsum stack (OU2) which is the source of significant surface water contamination. Primary contaminants are metals and acidity (pH) in surface water and groundwater. In addition to the RIs and removal work being conducted, the United States Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the former 107-acre plant property to Seven Seas Terminals, LLC in July 2023.  Seven Seas plans to demolish existing above ground infrastructure and redevelop the former DAP manufacturing plant area as a dry bulk storage and tank terminal operation. As a part of the Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser Agreement, Seven Seas will conduct a removal action to address contaminated soils within the plant property.<br/><br/><br/>",

There is insufficient data to determine if workers who may enter the manholes would be exposed to unacceptable levels of contamination in the air and water. The Navy has agreed to seal the storm water drains and/or manholes to prevent intrusion of contaminated groundwater from Site 45. Once sealed and flushed, the manholes and pipes would no longer contain contaminated groundwater from Site 45. Therefore, there would be no need for additional air data or monitoring. The Site 45 ROD requiring this remedial action is complete. The RD and RAWP are in progress. The remedy component sealing the storm sewers will need to be completed before status of the HE indicator can be reconsidered. There are approximately 18 sites remaining at MCRD where HE may not be under control or insufficient data exists to make a determination. Progress has been made at a significant number of these potential sites. However, they may continue to impact the EI determination even after Site 45 is remediated.",

EPA completed the site-wide remedial investigation and risk assessment. The 2020 ROD called for addressing residential properties (OU-2) that may have been impacted from potential migration from the former manufacturing facility via the stormwater ditch systems during heavy rain events and the cleanup activities in the selected properties are on-going. At the recommendation of a local arborist, the cleanup at one remaining residential property has been delayed until the winter of 2023 in an attempt to prevent or minimize damage to the roots of mature trees that are located in or near surface soils that need to be addressed to ensure protection of human health and the environment.  <br/><br/>Additional sampling is required to address data gaps that have been identified to fully determine nature and extent of contamination. Potential exposure pathways that may require further investigation include direct contact from contaminated soil on-site. Many of the outstanding data gaps are expected to be addressed in the ROD addressing the (Former Main Facility OU-3 and OU-5), which is currently scheduled to be issued before December 2023. A site-wide human health risk assessment is expected to be completed in 2024. The public has been informed through public meetings, Zoom calls and periodic fact sheets to provide updates of the site status and upcoming activities. The EPA has resumed providing updates and other site related information through regular meetings with the community.<br/>",

The levels of methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (primarily Aroclor 1268) detected in fish fillets resulted in a fish consumption advisory for the Turtle River/Brunswick Estuary issued by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources from 1995 to the present. EPA issued the cleanup plan for the marsh (Operable Unit 1) in September 2015, the remedial design has been completed and EPA expects to begin the remedial action in 2023. EPA will continue to advise that fish at the site should not be consumed. EPA has prepared a Community Involvement Plan, and provides updates and other information about the site through regular meetings.<br/><br/>",

(TAMPA PLANT) Superfund site is considered “Insufficient Data to make a Human Exposure evaluation” (HEID). “EPA uses this Human Exposure status when there is insufficient data/evidence to determine whether actual or reasonably anticipated human exposures are occurring, and/or whether those exposures are above acceptable risk-based levels. The 2021 FYR included a screening for vapor intrusion. The vapor intrusion screening-level (VISL) analysis indicates a potential for the vapor intrusion pathway to exceed the industrial screening levels using the groundwater data collected from a site well along the western edge of Orient Road, between two businesses. Both businesses are enclosed structures and are located directly above the surficial aquifer BTEX plume. The buildings of concern house a recycling facility that often has bay doors open but no A/C. These screening level results indicate that additional investigation is needed to determine the if the VI exposure pathway is completed and if the levels warrant additional action. The Site team is working with the current owner to gain access for the PRP to complete a vapor intrusion investigation that will include sampling of the outdoor air, indoor air and sub-slab air. EPA currently anticipates that there will be sufficient data to make a Human Exposure determination by 9/30/2024 because the PRP is currently working to obtain access for vapor intrusion sampling multiple rounds of sampling may be warranted.

(Pensacola Plant) Site is designated as \"Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because 55 residential properties have levels of dioxin above EPA's cleanup level in soil.  A site wide Record of Decision (ROD) was signed in September 2017.  The residential exposure units are triggered into CERCLA action by EPA’s HI=1 of 50 parts per trillion (ppt).  In each exposure unit, the residential yards will be cleaned up to FDEP’s Soil Cleanup Target Level (SCTL) of 7 ppt. Some offsite parcels have already been cleaned up and approximately 200,000 gallons of creosote have been removed to date. A Remedial Design (RD) was finished in September 2019.  The Remedial Action (RA) is funded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The Army Corps of Engineers are in the process of putting the funds to a contractor to perform the Remedial Action. The remedial action should start early 2024 and be completed within three years. The first scheduled action is to clean up residential properties. The remedial action will be ready to start and could be completed within three years.  EPA has prepared a Community Involvement Plan, and provides updates and other information about the site through regular meetings.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of August 2023, the Alabama Army Ammunition Plant site is considered Human Exposure Insufficient Data because asbestos has been discovered onsite. In 2015, EPA issued the Army a request for Additional work under the FFA. The Army completed an internal investigation and what they described as \"housekeeping\" in 2018. Portions of the visual asbestos were removed, however, the remaining surface, subsurface and invisible asbestos has yet to be characterized. Onsite developers, maintenance workers, trespasser could be exposed. Since tat time, progress toward a final cleanup has been stalled due to a dispute between the EPA and Army on acceptable actions to meet the CERCLA cleanup program. This informal dispute was resolved in September 2022. Part of the dispute resolution agreement requires the Army to establish a new operable unit for asbestos and address asbestos under the CERCLA process using EPA’s Framework for Investigating Asbestos-Contaminated CERCLA Sites, OLEM Directive No, 9200.0-90. This will be a multiyear process that will involve addressing areas of potential asbestos contamination by prioritizing active or occupied areas of ALAAP first. Final cleanup will likely require 2-3 years once work begins.",

The pre-final draft human health risk assessment indicates that the only exposure route outside the secured area which may present an unacceptable risk to people would be recreational users of the Monongahela River, which is adjacent to the site, coming into contact with deep sediments contaminated with coal tar residues, including carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (CaPAHs).    Potential contact with deep sediment (>1feet) is considered under a future use scenario as local developers are considering construction of a marina along the river bank.  As of November 2007, EPA removed contaminated sediment from the tributary and installed a seep collection system to prevent contamination from moving further.  EPA is currently completing an investigation to determine what additional work should be conducted.  EPA issues fact sheet updating the community on site progress in September 2006 and has assigned a Community Involvement Coordinator to answer community member questions and concerns.\r<br/>",

Clarke and Son Superfund Site, a former wood treating plant.  The surface soil at the upland portion of the site meets the clean-up level for carcinogenic polynuclear aromatics (cPNAs) EPA expects to adopt in a future decision document.  The sediments in the flood plain of Massaponax Creek were previously excavated and disposed of off-site.  However, EPA cannot be assured that the sediments have not become re-contaminated because neither the subsurface soil nor the ground water in the upland area were remediated.  Although a fence was constructed, it cannot completely encircle the site because there is an active railroad siding traversing the site,  As such, trespassers could be exposed to unacceptable levels of cPNAs.  The activities planned to make the Human Exposure Control determination include: re-sampling of the flood plain sediments in the Spring of 2012, and implementing any necessary remedial actions after the Decision Document is finalized. The results of the investigations will enable EPA to make a Human Exposure determination for the site and to ensure that appropriate actions are taken to control exposures, if necessary.  ",

Initial results indicate that there are elevated concentrations of VOCs in the sub-slab and at concentrations near action levels in indoor air, but concentrations are variable. Additional sampling is necessary to assess the seasonal variability of the potential vapor intrusion. This building was sold and is currently empty. A comfort letter has been issued for s VI mitigation system to be installed in the existing building and a VI mitigation system to be installed in any new building prior to use.<br/><br/>The OU1 plume has been defined enough to allow for design of the remedy in the 2016 ROD Amendment, however, the OU2 plume is not yet delineated.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "The Palmerton Zinc Superfund site is considered Current Human Exposures Controlled because of site progress and site condition changes evaluated during the most recent five year review (09/28/2007).  Specifically, reevaluation of residential properties with lead contaminated soil under Operable Unit 3 found that shortly after the ROD was issued (10/09/2001), the Real Estate Seller Disclosure Law (Pa. C.S.A. §§ 7301 - 7315) became effective in Pennsylvania.  This law provides that sellers of residential property must disclose any material defects with the property known to the seller prior to the signing of an agreement of sale with respect to the property.  Material defects are defined to specifically include the presence of hazardous substances on the property.  The Real Estate Seller Disclosure Law also places an affirmative duty on the agent representing the seller to advise the seller of his responsibilities under the law and to provide the seller with a copy of the disclosure form required by the law.  A seller who does not disclose a material defect, such as the presence of hazardous substances on the property, is liable for the actual damages suffered by the buyer as a result of that failure.  Therefore, EPA has determined that no further action regarding implementation of institutional controls in connection with Operable Unit 3 is required.   However, the remedial investigation/feasibility study for Operable Unit 4 needs to be completed and a remedy selected and implemented before the Site can be considered construction complete.  The Operable Unit 4 ROD is planned for 2009. \r<br/>\r<br/>",

Based on the Final Remedial Investigation Report, unacceptable risks to current recreational users in portions of the site are due primarily to lead in subsurface soil, surface soil, sediments, and surface water. The OU1 ROD was signed in 2021. The OU1 ROD’s selected remedy is to perform a combination of excavation and disposal of soils and sediment contaminated with lead, as well as the addition of amendments in the form of in situ stabilization to reduce the toxicity of lead in the environment and the use of Institutional Controls will reduce or eliminate current exposure pathways. Additionally, thermal remediation will treat a CVOC source area in OU1. The Remedial Design is complete for OU1 and Remedial Action for OU1 will start in 2023. The OU2 remedial investigation/feasibility study is complete, where alternatives were evaluated to address contaminated soils and sediments in the Sandy Lick Creek floodplain area. The OU2 remedial design will be complete in 2023, and EPA is currently drafting the interim ROD for OU2 and will be complete in 2023.",

The Site was promulgated on<br/>the NPL in March 2012 and the Remedial Investigation for the Site was approved in March 2020. The responsible parties are performing a<br/>Feasibility Study for the Site and it is scheduled to be complete by April 2023. Currently, surface and subsurface soil contamination consisting of<br/>metals (primarily lead) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) pose a potential exposure pathway to human receptors. A removal action removed<br/>lead and PCBs from surface soils on portions of the residential properties to remove risk but soil and sediment contamination continues to pose a<br/>potential exposure pathway to human receptors on the non-residential property to recreational users or trespassers.",

The remedy to address these residential properties was selected in 2018 and is in the design phase. It is anticipated that a contract for the implementation of the cleanups will be awarded in 2023.  The Creek sediments are contaminated with a number of contaminants, the most prevalent being polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Other pollutants include mercury, lead, copper, pesticides/insecticides, dioxins, and furans. EPA has already completed several efforts to date to address risks identified at the site pursuant to a remedy selected in 2013. These efforts have included the demolition and removal of a contaminated production plant; the relocation of residents living on floodplain properties that had been contaminated by Creek flooding; and the acquisition and demolition of PCB-contaminated properties in the floodplains. A remedy for the most contaminated portion of the Creek and adjoining properties has also been selected. The implementation of the remedy for the most contaminated portion of the creek and for 32 residential properties contaminated with lead, will be initiated in FY24.  A remedial investigation, feasibility study risk assessment and proposed plan for the next portion of the downstream reaches of the stream (approximately 5.4 miles) are expected to be completed this in 2023. The evaluation of the remainder of the Creek is still ongoing. <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of May 2023, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Area - Vieques Superfund Site is considered \"Human exposure not under control\" due to extensive amounts of unexploded ordnance. The site includes certain areas of the island of Vieques and nearby waters that have become contaminated by munitions and explosives of concern, primarily by United States Department of Defense (DoD) activities. From the 1940s until 2003, the US Navy administered lands on both the western and eastern ends of Vieques Island. The lands were used for military training and operations (ship-to-shore gun fire, air-to-ground bombing by naval aircraft, Marine amphibious landing, or combinations), and to store munitions for Atlantic Fleet training. Extensive amounts of unexploded ordnance and remnants of exploded ordnance have been identified in the range areas of Vieques, and in the surrounding waters. The Navy is currently conducting removal of surface munitions and explosives of concern in the impact area in east Vieques. These actions need to be coordinated with additional remedial investigation work to evaluate the nature and extent of contamination. Currently, hazardous substances that may be present at the site have not been fully characterized, but may include mercury, lead, copper, magnesium, lithium, perchlorate, TNT, depleted uranium, PCBs, solvents, and pesticides. As areas being addressed under the time critical removal action are completed, the Navy has initiated remedial investigation(s)/feasibility studies to define the nature and extent of the contamination. A wide area assessment to assist in the planning of the remedial investigation (RI) of underwater munitions was completed and the navy is currently working on the RI/FS.   To date, seven records of decision have been approved and the remedies implemented for five upland areas.  In addition, a site investigation for potential PFAS contamination is also underway.<br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by participating in routine quarterly Restoration Advisory Board meetings with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets. A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site. Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of May 2023, there is insufficient information to determine the site-wide Human Exposure Control status at the Matteo & Sons, Inc. Superfund Site due to an ongoing remedial investigation at OU3. Contaminated surface water, sediments and groundwater will be addressed in OU3. The remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) for these media will be conducted to determine the nature and extent of contamination.  Once the RI is complete, a risk assessment will be prepared to determine the potential impact to human health and the environment from these contamination pathways, at which time a sitewide human exposure determination can be made.  <br/><br/>The OU1 portion of the site is located on an approximately 80-acre property containing an active scrap metal recycling facility, a junkyard, and an inactive landfill. Woodbury Creek borders it to the west, Hessian Run to the north, and a residential trailer park to the south. Sources of contamination on the site include an approximately 224,000-square-foot pile of crushed battery casings, an approximately 260,000-square-foot inactive landfill in the north-central portion of the site, and lead- and PCB-contaminated soil located throughout the property. The company deposited crushed battery casings directly into Hessian Run and the wetlands adjacent to it, altering the shoreline. Matteo (under NJDEP oversight), NJDEP and EPA all have conducted investigations at the site. EPA sampling in 2005 and 2006 revealed crushed battery casings and lead contamination adjacent to and in the trailer park. Under a May 2006 Administrative Consent Order issued by EPA, Matteo installed a chain-link fence to restrict access to contaminated areas. To facilitate the fence installation, approximately 425 tons of contaminated soil were excavated for off-site disposal.   A Record of Decision was issued in October 2019 to address contaminated soil onsite and on the banks of Hessian Run and the design of the remedy is underway.  A removal action was completed in September 2020 to remove contaminated soil at a commercial facility which is part of OU1.  The remedial design for OU1 was completed in March 2023 and implementation of the remedy is expected to begin in 2024.<br/><br/>OU2 of the Matteo and Sons, Inc. Superfund site is a residential neighborhood in West Deptford, NJ. Prior to residential development the crushed battery casing waste was used as fill and during construction the waste was distributed throughout the neighborhood. Approximately 25 of the 36 residential properties comprising the neighborhood are impacted with battery casing waste and soil with elevated concentrations of lead, antimony, and PCBs. Battery casing waste and soil impacts are predominantly in the surface and shallow sub-surface soil. Exposure pathways to the battery casing waste and impacted soil in the residential yards are complete and uncontrolled.  A ROD was issued in 2017 and a remedial action for excavation of residential properties was completed in 2022.<br/><br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets. A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site. Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of May 2023, the Arsenic Mine Superfund Site is considered \"Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because of continuing exposure to arsenic on residential properties. In April 2019, the Removal Program mobilized to perform interim actions to protect public health, including providing residents indoor and outdoor door mats and boot brushes, excavating soil in dog pens and backfilling with wood chips, creating woodchip or stone walkways, and paving or adding stone to driveways. In addition, periodic drinking water assessments started in April 2019.  Because arsenic concentrations in the surface soil on residential properties greatly exceed state and federal residential soil screening values, ATSDR determined that current and potential future exposures to arsenic in residential soil on the site warranted the issuance of a Public Health Advisory. In its April 2019 Public Health Advisory, ATSDR recommended that EPA take short- and long-term measures as soon as feasible to dissociate residents from exposure to arsenic in soils on the site.  The site was listed on the NPL in October 2019.  A ROD for the dissociation of residents on six properties was issued on June 29, 2020. Pursuant to an IAG, the Baltimore District of USACE made offers to acquire the six properties.  One property owner declined the offer.  Of the five properties, USACE  has acquired four of them and has relocated the residents.  The structures are being scheduled for demolition. It is currently anticipated that closing for the remaining property will occur later this year. Fieldwork for OU2, which will focus on the nature and extent of contamination at the site, is expected to begin in summer/fall of 2024. <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets. A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.   An EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of May 2023, the Hudson River PCBs Superfund Site is considered Human Exposure Not Under Control because of the potential for ingestion of fish caught from the river by those who do not follow the fish consumption advisories and fishing restriction. Remedial activities completed to date (dredging) have substantially reduced PCB source materials in the Upper Hudson River. As expected in the Record of Decision, average PCB concentrations in fish in the Upper Hudson are declining but have not yet reached protective levels. Because the remedy includes not only the dredging component but also the subsequent period of monitored natural attenuation, the remedy is not complete until the natural attenuation component also has been completed. EPA believes it is likely that improvement will occur gradually over several decades at least. In the interim, the State of New York has in place fishing restrictions and advisories against consumption of fish to control human exposure pathways that could result in unacceptable risks. EPA acknowledges that the consumption advisories are not fully effective in that they rely on voluntary compliance in order to prevent or limit fish consumption. EPA will continue to work with New York State to ensure the ongoing maximum effectiveness of the advisories.<br/><br/>Dredging work was completed in 2015. EPA estimates that the dredging project removed about 72% of the mass of PCBs in the Upper Hudson River.  The dredging project resulted in the removal of about 2.75 million cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment. Approximately 310,000 pounds of PCBs (twice the mass anticipated) were permanently removed from the river.  <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets. EPA maintains a project website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise. A Community Advisory Group (CAG) comprised of members representing diverse interests along the river has been established to disseminate site information and solicit public comments on project activities.",

The Lower Hackensack River is under fish and shellfish consumption advisories, issued by NJDEP based on polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dioxin and/or mercury contamination.  A Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) is currently being planned to determine the nature and extent of contamination.  Once the RI/FS is completed, a remedy will be selected to address human exposures. In the meanwhile, planned activities to address the pathway include working with the state to ensure fish consumption advisory signs are posted.<br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of May 2023, there is insufficient information to determine the site-wide human exposure control status at the Wappinger Creek site.  The Wappinger Creek site in Wappinger Falls, New York, is the location of contaminated sediments for which the sources of contamination have not been definitively identified. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) collected surface water and sediment samples from this tidally influenced creek and from Wappinger Lake upstream.  The analytical results for the samples indicated that creek sediments are contaminated with several inorganic constituents and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) at concentrations above NYSDEC screening values.  In May of 2021, EPA initiated field work for the Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study to further define the nature and extent of contamination at the site. Once the study is complete, EPA can determine the best cleanup method for the site.  The potential exposure pathways are not yet identified.  It is not anticipated that the risk assessment will be completed before 2024, as a result a site-wide human exposure determination is not anticipated to be made before 2024.<br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.",

This pathway involves the inhalation of VOCs that have potentially migrated from the groundwater to indoor air.  Up until 2021, the removal program has been utilized to remediate the homes that have been impacted. In 2021, EPA selected a remedy to address vapor intrusion into residential and commercial properties at the site; as a result, mitigation efforts are under the remedial program. In addition, the PRPs are conducting an additional investigation of the groundwater beyond the industrial property and will determine the extent of the site-related plume, and the potential that another non-site related source could be contributing to groundwater contamination and VI concerns.

Prior to the site being added to the NPL, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation implemented a number of actions to mitigate potential exposures to humans in the vicinity of the landfill, including containment of the landfill, pumping and treatment of some impacted groundwater, and removal of PCB-contaminated soil and sediments from tributaries feeding Nassau Lake.  EPA has also implemented a removal action that resulted in the construction of a treatment plant that allows collection of groundwater and leachate year-round, and on-site treatment (rather than seasonal collection with off-site trucking and treatment).  A second removal action was initiated in 2018 to address significant sediment contamination in one of the drainageways feeding Nassau Lake; this removal action was approximately 50% complete in the fall of 2019, however unexpected significant lateral contamination into the sides of the steep banks of the drainageway resulted in the termination of the removal action with the remainder of the drainageway being addressed under the remedial process.  Nassau Lake is used recreationally and as a local fishery, however, there is currently a ban on fish consumption for Nassau Lake due to PCB levels found in nearly all species native to the lake.  As the site is being addressed by PRP removal actions and a phased remedial program, risk assessments for the entire site are not expected to be completed until 2026; at that time EPA will have sufficient information to determine the site-wide human exposure control status.  <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices, and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.   A Community Advisory Group (CAG) comprised of members representing interests in the community meets regularly and serves as a forum to disseminate Site information and solicit public comments on project activities.

The OU4 remedy calls for excavation of floodplain soils and Bound Brook sediments containing PCBs over 1 mg/kg with off-site disposal. Several institutional controls are called for in the ROD to be implemented at the site, including a fish advisory in the Bound Brook already established by NJDEP, a Classification Exception Area placed on the site on October 17, 2019, to restrict the installation of new drinking water wells and a deed notice for Hamilton Industrial Park to assure remedy protectiveness. The deed notice or other legal instrument would assure that the land use does not become residential/unrestricted in the future. <br/><br/>The remedy requires continued signage in English and Spanish to remind anglers and other recreational users of the Bound Brook corridor of the presence of PCBs in sediments and fish, and the need to take preventative measures, such as catch-and-release, when in the area.<br/><br/>EPA is currently designing the cleanup of PCB-contaminated sediment and flood plain soils in Bound Brook downstream of Hamilton Industrial Park, as part of OU4 Phase 4. OU4 Phase 4 has been split into several Reaches, and remediation of the first Reach of OU4 Phase 4 is underway. <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents, local government officials, and affected stakeholders, obtaining Consent for Access from landowners before starting remedial actions when possible, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.   Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.",

Sampling has shown that soil, groundwater, surface water and sediment in the vicinity of the site have elevated concentrations of arsenic and lead. A number of actions are currently taking place to mitigate potential exposure to these contaminants. These actions include (1) the cleanup and restoration of impacted residential properties in the vicinity of the former Kil-Tone facility. As of May 2023, 32 residential properties have been fully addressed and at least another 46 residential properties still need to be addressed; (2) design of the cleanup of at least 40 impacted non-residential properties in the vicinity of the former facility; (3) continued development of the remedial investigation and feasibility study for groundwater in the vicinity of the site, and; (4) performance of the remedial investigation and feasibility study for the surface water and sediment of the Tarkiln Branch, as well as for the floodplain of the branch. The Tarkiln Branch is a tributary to Parvin Branch which feeds into the Maurice River and eventually Union Lake.  The Maurice River and Union Lake are used recreationally. NJDEP has issued fish consumption advisories for the Maurice River and Union Lake for issues unrelated to the Former Kil-Tone Company site.  EPA will continue to conduct further studies to determine if arsenic and lead are impacting these water bodies. <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices, and updating fact sheets.

Key public areas have been posted with safety/security/public health signage while EPA collects additional data and works with the State on fish consumption advisories. <br/><br/>EPA has already initiated cleanup activities at the site.  Currently, a remedy has been implemented for the uplands portion of the site.  Mercury-contaminated soils have been excavated from the uplands area and disposed of off-site.  Areas with soils containing mercury above residential levels have been capped and prepared for industrial redevelopment, and Institutional Controls (ICs) have been placed on eight properties.  Mercury-contaminated soils have also been removed from ditches that lead from the uplands to the wetlands of Berry’s Creek.  A vertical hydraulic barrier system was installed to capture contaminated groundwater and prevent migration into the Berry’s Creek watershed.  ICs in the form of a Classification Exception Area and Well Restriction Area are in place to prevent use of contaminated groundwater.  An interim remedy to address contaminated sediments within certain reaches of the Berry’s Creek portion of the Site, OU2, and contaminated soils at the Upper Peach Island Creek marsh was finalized in 2018, and the design of this interim remedy began in 2019 with estimated completion in 2024. This interim remedy will remove sediments and marsh soils contaminated with mercury, methylmercury, PCBs and chromium.  Methylmercury and PCBs have also been identified in fish and crab tissue.  Studies to address contamination in the marshes and in the downgradient reaches of Berry's Creek will be conducted once the interim remedy is completed.  <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of May 2023, there is insufficient information to determine the site-wide human exposure status at the Helen Kramer site in Mantua Twp, New Jersey. The site is a 66 acre landfill that was estimated to have received several million gallons of chemical wastes, including waste solvents and paints. In addition, over two million cubic yards of solid waste were estimated to have been disposed of at the landfill. The waste is believed to be more than 50 feet deep in most areas. The wastes disposed of included hazardous, industrial, septic, municipal, and hospital wastes. A Record of Decision (ROD) was issued in 1985, which selected a containment remedy for the site. The selected remedy included: construction of a clay cap over the site, dewatering, excavation, and filling of the leachate ponds and lagoons, construction of an upgradient slurry wall, construction of a groundwater/leachate collection trench and collection and treatment of the groundwater/leachate from the trench, construction of an active gas collection and treatment system, implementation of surface water controls, construction of a security fence surrounding the site and work areas implementation of a monitoring program to assess the effectiveness and reliability of the remedial action (RA), and operation and maintenance (O&M), as required, to ensure the continued effectiveness of the remedy.  Implementation of the remedy was completed in 1995.  Under an agreement with NJ Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), in 1997 the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) took over O&M of the remedy from NJDEP and continue to perform these activities.<br/><br/>Groundwater sampling conducted as part of O&M indicates that groundwater contamination is migrating past the landfill containment system into both the shallow and deep aquifers. It is currently unknown if shallow groundwater contamination  is discharging to the Edwards Run Creek.   Contaminants of Concern include VOCs, PFAS, and 1,4-dioxane.  The PRPs are looking into the optimization of the groundwater extraction and treatment system to optimize the shallow groundwater extraction. A Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) is being conducted for the deep groundwater to determine the nature and extent of the deep aquifer and groundwater contamination downgradient of the landfill. Once the RI is completed, a risk assessment will be prepared to determine the potential impact to human health and the environment. It is anticipated that upon completion of the risk assessments and the selection of the remedy, a sitewide human exposure determination can be made. EPA currently ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets. A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.

The Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, approximately 35 acres of which are part of the site, also borders the site to the south and east. A remedial investigation of soil, groundwater, sediment and surface water was completed in 2018.  A human health risk assessment was completed in 2014 and updated in 2018 and found that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil at the landfill pose an unacceptable risk to trespassers or passive recreators. Groundwater sampling to date indicates isolated areas of contamination consisting primarily of metals, PCBs and benzene, and that contamination in groundwater is limited to a depth of about 25 feet below the surface, located above a thick confining clay layer in the landfilled area and is not migrating off-site. This shallow groundwater cannot be used for potable wells and nearby residents have a public water supply. PFAS contamination in groundwater was recently discovered and additional sampling is being conducted to determine the nature and extent of impact.

The site is fenced and abandoned, and early investigations did not identify a need for any short-term response actions beyond preventing access. Contaminants at the site include chromium, lead, dioxin, PCB aldrin and PCB Aroclors in soil and sediment.  At one time an \"oil lake\" was present over portions of the site, and remnants of this release are still evident in site samples. In 2009 EPA selected an early action remedy to address the remnants of the \"oil lake\".  A bench scale study indicated the selected remedy would not be effective.  In 2017, EPA amended the remedy to address the oil lake remnants and also issued a Record of Decision to address contaminated soil and sediment at the remainder of the site. The remedy to address the remnants of the oil lake as well as soil and sediment is currently under construction. The groundwater for the site is to be addressed under a separate operable unit.  It is anticipated that upon completion of this risk assessment and the selection of this remedy, a sitewide human exposure determination can be made.  <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.

Key public areas have been posted with safety/security/public health signage at town beaches while EPA collects additional data. <br/><br/>EPA has already completed a significant portion of cleanup activities at the site.  Currently, a groundwater extraction and treatment system is operating to manage the off-site migration of groundwater contaminated with arsenic; institutional controls are also in place to restrict potable use of the contaminated groundwater until the aquifer is restored.  In addition, treatment of plant site soils, considered the primary source of the arsenic contamination, is complete.  Contaminated sediments from the stream and wetland have been removed and that area has been restored back to the original Atlantic White Cedar wetlands.  The present focus of remedial activities is on preventing groundwater seeps from contaminating sediments in limited areas of the floodplain, and the site is being re-evaluated on a holistic basis, through creation of a new OU, to address this concern, and the ROD is expected to be completed in 2025. EPA continues to perform periodic monitoring of water and sediment and review this data with State government representatives. Several years of annual sediment and surface water monitoring data at recreational areas downstream have shown no unacceptable risk.<br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.

The site consists of Pierson’s Creek, which discharges to Newark Bay approximately 1.5 miles downstream of its headwaters, and several sources of contamination to the creek, including the Troy Chemical Corporation facility, located just upstream of Pierson's Creek. Prior to the facility's current operations, the facility was occupied by other industrial operators since the late 1800s. Mercury compounds were manufactured at the facility and the mercury wastewater was treated on-site with sulfide precipitation prior to discharge to the creek. In addition to the discharge of mercury-contaminated wastewater, there is a history of spills and discharges to the ground surface characterized by puddles of chemicals on the ground, and mercury droplets on the ground and in runoff reaching Pierson's Creek.<br/><br/>The site consists of two operable units. The site has been the focus of numerous investigations since the 1970s, but actions to date have not addressed mercury contamination downstream. EPA is currently working on a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) for Operable Unit 1 of the site which consists of the Creek and an upland area where dredge spoils were sidecast. An Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) was signed with Troy Chemical Corporation in November 2017 in which they agreed to perform an RI/FS on their property. This RI/FS is being performed as Operable Unit 2 of the Pierson's Creek site and is currently underway, expected completion in 2024. Once each RI is completed, a risk assessment for each operable unit will be prepared to determine the potential impact to human health and the environment.

Soils at the site are predominantly contaminated with arsenic, chromium, lead, and PAHs.  EPA issued a Record of Decision for soils and groundwater in 2011.  The implementation of the soil remedy involving solidification and stabilization of contaminated soil began in 2017 and was completed on the Quanta property in 2021.  Two additional areas need to be addressed to complete the OU1 remediation. Remedial design is being conducted to address contamination beneath an adjoining county road ias well as a high concentration arsenic area to the north of the Quanta property.  Groundwater underneath the site and adjacent properties is contaminated with arsenic, chromium, lead, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Operable Unit 2 (OU2) of the site addresses Hudson River surface water and sediments.  Sediments in the Hudson River adjoining the site contain arsenic,  lead, PAHs, VOCs, and non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL).  A NAPL plume exists beneath the Quanta Resources site and under portions of adjacent properties and extends approximately 750 feet into the Hudson River. At low tide, discharges of NAPL from the mudflat are visible, creating sheens.  EPA is finalizing a Feasibility Study to develop remedial alternatives for  OU2 of the Quanta Resources site.  A proposed remedial action plan for OU2 is expected to be released in summer 2023. <br/><br/>EPA ensures community participation throughout the remedial process by meeting with residents and affected stakeholders, issuing public notices and updating fact sheets.  A site profile has been established on the EPA website to keep the community informed of recent progress at the site.  Additionally, an EPA Community Involvement Coordinator is assigned to the site and can address specific community concerns as they arise.   Assistance was provided to the community to establish and maintain a Community Advisory Group.  Representatives have met privately with concerned citizens and the CAG to explain science and health issues.",

Routine trespassing within the former mill occurs and all efforts to prevent such trespassing continues to fail. Additionally, contamination in the former mill building is being released to the environment (the adjacent Presumpscot River) given the deteriorated condition of the building, which is contributing to unacceptable fish consumption risk due to uptake via the food chain.<br/><br/>The Keddy Mill Superfund site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in May 2014. EPA initiated a Remedial Investigation (RI), to include a risk assessment, which is was completed in 2023. Of concern is an abandoned and contaminated former Mill complex. In FY2018, the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) completed an Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analysis (EE/CA) resulting in EPA's selection of a demolition alternative that was memorialized in an Action Memorandum. In April 2019, EPA issued notice letters inviting the PRP to perform the Non-time Critical Removal Action (NTCRA). An AOC was reached with the PRP to perform additional geophysical testing and drainage assessment needed to properly and safely demolish the mill; site security measures were also included and are in the process of being implemented. Despite the attempts by the PRP to secure the mill complex property, trespassers are still able to access exterior portions of the parcel and the abandoned building. An AOC was negotiated and signed with PRPs in June 2022 to implement the NTCRA. Ahead of the mill's actual demolition, additional data needs to be collected from various media which comprise the mill (e.g., concrete, chalking, tile, other porous surfaces); this work is anticipated to begin in 2023 with the removal design to follow in 2024. The mobilization of equipment, supplies, and personnel to begin the physical demolition of the mill building is planned for September 2024.  EPA will reevaluate if this substantial mobilization to conduct the NTCRA is a sufficient deterrent to on-site trespassing and thus if Human Exposure may change to Under Control. <br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "As of September 2023, the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because nearby residents and recreational users of the Woonasquatucket River are reasonably anticipated to be exposed to unacceptable levels of dioxin and other contaminants through contact with sediment in the river and floodplain. Ingestion of fish from the Woonasquatucket River also poses an unacceptable risk. The river and riverbank are active recreational areas. This Human Exposure Control determination is based primarily on risk assessment(s) prepared for the site that took concentration of chemicals present and the frequency/duration of exposure to these chemicals, among other things, into account. EPA has removed some contaminated soil located in the backyards of some residences immediately adjacent to the river and installed fences restricting access to contaminated sediment in these areas. EPA has also capped the source area of contamination, reconstructed the Allendale Dam, and excavated other source material that was contributing to groundwater contamination in order to prevent further migration of contamination.  The primary component of the remedy outlined in the ROD calls for excavation of a large volume of contaminated material, and the remedy is expected to be completed in 2028.<br/><br/>A Rhode Island Department of Public Health fishing advisory has been in place since the mid-1990s. EPA continues to work with the Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council to develop annual fact sheets that remind residents about using the river responsibly. EPA also holds periodic dialogue forums with community groups, local citizens, elected officials, and state and federal agencies to discuss the cleanup for the site.<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

This insufficiency is due to the limited number of site investigations that have occurred over the last several years to determine the nature and extent of the soil, sludge, sediment and groundwater contamination resulting from past tannery operations.    <br/><br/>The city has requested that additional funding mechanisms for cleanup be pursued (including through redevelopment of the site).  In 2007, EPA's removal program responded to a fire at the site based on a request from local fire officials.  Public updates and a press event were held during this response effort.  In 2012, the City of Nashua funded and completed the demolition of the former tannery buildings. In addition, EPA and NHDES conducted several field investigation activities in the summer/fall of 2012 within the southernmost 15-acre parcel of the overall 30-acre Site.  The purpose of the activities was to evaluate whether all or a portion of this undeveloped, 15-acre southern parcel can be redeveloped without the need for remediation. <br/><br/>An evaluation of acceptable remedial alternatives is currently being conducted. Once available information and the review of remedial alternatives is completed, the site-wide Human Exposure determination for the site will be updated. <br/><br/>",

      "humanexposurepathdesc": "The Callahan Mining Corporation Superfund site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because PCBs are present in surface soil above levels considered acceptable for contact by a recreational or trespass visitor to the site.  The September 30, 2009 Record of Decision (ROD) identified the PCBs as a principal threat waste.  The ROD also identified the PCBs, lead, and arsenic as contaminants of concern that will be the focus of a portion of the cleanup action. \r<br/>\r<br/>This Human Exposure Control determination is based primarily on human health risk assessment(s) prepared for the site that took concentration of chemicals present and the frequency/duration of exposure to these chemicals, among other things, into account.  The primary contaminants of concern at the residential properties are arsenic and lead.  The primary concern for the non-residential portion of the site is PCBs.  \r<br/>\r<br/>The 2009 ROD outlines the remedy for the site.  Among other things, the ROD calls for the excavation and off-site disposal of soil above the site-specific cleanup values. The 2009 ROD also includes actions to protect ecological receptors from exposure to contaminated sediment and seeps and containment of the waste rock and tailing.\r<br/>\r<br/>Cleanup work to address unacceptable current human exposure was initiated in 2011.  During the remedial work, the extent and quatity of PCB contamination was found to be more signficant than anticipated.  While the on-site PCB cleanup will not be complete until 2013, arsenic and lead contamination has been removed from the residential properties.  Cleanup of the five residential properties is complete.  \r<br/>\r<br/>",

This Human Exposure Control determination is based on site-specific risk assessments that took concentration of chemicals present and the frequency/duration of exposure to these chemicals, among other things, into account. <br/><br/>EPA's full scale dredging program began in 2004 and accelerated in 2014 after a cash-out settlement with the main responsible party. Additional $72+M funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law was provided in 2022 to fund the project to completion. Subtidal dredging is now complete, and work is underway on several areas of intertidal shoreline contamination.<br/><br/>EPA operates an outreach campaign to dissuade the consumption of local PCB-contaminated seafood. This effort includes the education and medical communities, as well as meetings with stakeholders and local officials. Signs are posted in multiple languages around the harbor shoreline describing the current fishing restrictions.  Additionally, EPA produced and posted a video on its New Bedford Harbor project website about the hazards of consuming contaminated fish from various areas of the harbor. Nonetheless, EPA continues to receive reports that consumption of seafood from posted areas is ongoing among some residents.<br/>",

Superfund site is considered \"Current Human Exposure Not Under Control\" because individuals could come into contact with soil contaminated with lead, asbestos, and PCBs above acceptable levels at approximately 6 remaining OU6 locations (note: as a result of the sampling and ongoing remedial construction activities, the number of total number of properties contaminated with Raymark Waste  increased to 30 of which remedial action is still needed at 6 OU6 properties as well as the Shore Road Area, referred to as “OU5”). This Human Exposure Control determination is based primarily on risk assessment(s) prepared for the site. Direct contact with and inhalation of the dust associated with manufacturing waste exceeds acceptable levels.<br/><br/>EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) in July 2011 outlining final source control remedies at four locations and interim actions to reduce or restrict exposures through the use of institutional controls at the other locations. In September 2016, EPA issued another ROD outlining permanent remedies for 22 additional properties as well as Ferry Creek. Waste in soil, wetland soil, and sediment is being excavated and transported to OU4 (a former ballfield at the Raymark facility where some waste has already been placed), where it will be consolidated and capped. Remedial Designs for OU6 properties were completed in 2019. The implementation of the consolidation remedy is expected to last 6 years from the start of construction in 2019. For OU2 (the contaminated groundwater area), the remedy includes installation of vapor mitigation systems (VMS) at approximately 20 additional properties (mostly residential); this work was completed in FY2020 bringing the total number of properties with a VMS to 122. Investigations are ongoing at 3 additional OUs, for which EPA expects to issue cleanup proposals in the next 2 to 3 years.<br/>",
